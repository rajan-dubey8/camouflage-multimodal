  "explanation": "The chipmunk exhibits a form of camouflage primarily through its disruptive pattern, characterized by the distinct dark and light stripes on its back and face. These stripes help to break up the animal's outline, making it more difficult for predators to identify its form against the complex textures and shadows of its natural habitat, such as tree bark, ground litter, and foliage. Its overall fur coloration, a mix of earthy browns and tans, also provides some color blending with the natural environment, although in this specific image, against the vibrant green background, the chipmunk is moderately visible. The combination of disruptive stripes and natural coloration constitutes its camouflage strategy."
