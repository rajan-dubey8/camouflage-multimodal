  "explanation": "The Comma butterfly exhibits camouflage primarily through its distinctive, highly irregular and jagged wing shape, which is a key characteristic of disruptive patterns. This broken outline makes it difficult for predators to distinguish the insect's form against a complex natural background like bark or dead leaves, which its closed wings typically mimic. While the vibrant orange and black patterns on the open wings contrast with the green foliage, the jagged edges and mottled patterning still help to break up its silhouette. The dark brown areas on the wings also blend somewhat with the darker parts of the thistle flower heads."
