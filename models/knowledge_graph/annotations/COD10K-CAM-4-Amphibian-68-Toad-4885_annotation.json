  "explanation": "The toads exhibit excellent camouflage by blending seamlessly with their aquatic environment. Their rough, mottled brown and grey skin perfectly matches the color and texture of the murky water and the dark, possibly muddy or rocky substrate beneath. Being partially submerged in the water also helps to obscure their shape and blur their outlines, further reducing their visibility. The low contrast between the toads and their dark surroundings makes them very difficult to spot, effectively hiding them from predators, with only their eyes providing a slight point of contrast."
