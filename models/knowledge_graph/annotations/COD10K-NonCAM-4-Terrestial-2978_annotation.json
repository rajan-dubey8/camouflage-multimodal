  "explanation": "The image features a human snorkeler underwater, holding a conch shell. The human's skin tone, swimsuit, and snorkeling gear (mask, snorkel, gloves) contrast sharply with the surrounding blue-green water and green seagrass. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning to conceal the individual. The human's form, colors, and textures are distinct from the aquatic environment, making them highly visible."
