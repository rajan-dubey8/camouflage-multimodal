  "object_name": "Sunbird on flowering plant",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a green plant stem with small green leaves and several prominent vibrant purple/blue flowers and buds. The distant background is a soft, out-of-focus blur of light green and greyish-white, suggesting distant foliage or an open, bright environment.",

  "explanation": "The bird's vibrant and iridescent plumage, featuring brilliant blue-green on its head and neck, black on its face, a distinct reddish-brown patch on its chest, and iridescent green tail feathers, makes it highly conspicuous. Although its olive-green back shares some general color tones with the surrounding foliage, the striking iridescent colors, sharp outlines, and clear focus against a somewhat blurred background create a high contrast, preventing it from blending into its environment. This type of coloration is typically for display rather than concealment."
