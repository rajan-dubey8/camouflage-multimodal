  "explanation": "The Northern Cardinal, a male with its distinctive vibrant red plumage and black face mask, stands out dramatically against the soft green and yellowish blurred background. The bright red creates a very high color and luminance contrast with the surrounding environment, making the bird highly conspicuous and easily identifiable. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning to conceal the bird; in fact, its coloration serves as a display rather than for camouflage."
