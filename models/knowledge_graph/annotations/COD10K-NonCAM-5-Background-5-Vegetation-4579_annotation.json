  "background_description": "The background consists of a building wall with a reddish-pinkish-orange hue, likely painted or stucco, and a lighter blue-grey section, possibly a window frame or another part of the building. The foreground and mid-ground are filled with numerous thin, dark, bare tree branches, some with small thorns, creating a dense, linear pattern around the main subject.",
