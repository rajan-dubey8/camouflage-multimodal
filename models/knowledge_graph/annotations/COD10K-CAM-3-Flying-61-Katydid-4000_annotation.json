  "object_name": "Katydid",
  "background_description": "The background consists of dense green foliage, featuring various leaves and small budding plant structures. Some leaves are in sharp focus directly beneath and around the Katydid, displaying visible veins and natural textures, while other parts of the foliage further back are softly blurred, creating a natural, leafy environment with varying depths. The lighting is bright, suggesting direct sunlight.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The Katydid demonstrates effective camouflage through strong color blending. Its entire body, including its wings and legs, is a vibrant green, closely matching the various shades of green found in the surrounding leaves and plant structures. This high degree of color similarity significantly reduces its visibility against the foliage. While its insect form is still discernible upon close inspection, its elongated body and wing shape also somewhat mimic the linear structure of leaves, contributing to shape disruption. The low contrast difference between the organism and its background makes it blend seamlessly into its natural habitat, making it difficult for predators to spot."
