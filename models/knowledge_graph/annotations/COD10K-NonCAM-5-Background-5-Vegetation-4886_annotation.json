  "background_description": "A park scene featuring a paved pedestrian walkway on the right, which is extensively dappled with shadows from the overarching trees. The path is bordered by a strip of dense, green ground cover, beyond which lies a sunlit expanse of green grass with scattered yellowing leaves. A prominent line of mature trees, with rough, brown bark and a canopy of lush green and partially yellowing leaves, extends across the image. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating bright highlights and strong shadows. In the mid-ground, a large, light-colored polygonal stone sculpture is visible on the grass, surrounded by more trees and distant park elements.",
