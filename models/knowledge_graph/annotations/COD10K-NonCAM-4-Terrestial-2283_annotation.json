  "explanation": "The tiger exhibits camouflage through its distinctive striped pattern, which is a classic example of disruptive coloration. The black stripes on its orange-brown fur break up the animal's outline, making it harder for prey to detect in environments with dappled sunlight, tall grass, or dense foliage. While the current background is primarily rocky, the stripes still create visual confusion, blending the animal's form with varying light and shadow, and the tawny base color of its fur provides some color blending with the earthy tones of the rocks."
