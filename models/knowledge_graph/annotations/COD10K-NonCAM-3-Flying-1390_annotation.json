  "explanation": "The Wood Stork is predominantly white with black flight feathers and a dark head, bill, and legs. This color pattern creates a very high contrast against the clear, bright blue sky in the background, making the bird highly visible. While it is perched on a weathered tree branch, neither the bird's colors nor its texture blend with the branch or the expansive blue sky. Therefore, no camouflage is present; the bird stands out distinctly against its environment."
