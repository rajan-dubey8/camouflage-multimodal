  "explanation": "The piglet's light pink/white fur color and relatively smooth skin texture stand in stark contrast to the vibrant green, textured grass blades that make up its immediate surroundings. Its form is clearly defined against the background, and there is no visual blending in terms of color, pattern, or texture. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
