  "background_description": "The image captures a panoramic view of ocean waves under an overcast sky. The sky is a muted purplish-blue-grey, suggesting a stormy or moody atmosphere. The horizon line is visible in the distance where the dark ocean meets the sky. In the mid-ground, powerful turquoise-green waves are breaking, characterized by their vibrant color and frothy white crests and spray. Closer to the viewer, the water is a darker, deeper blue-green with ripples and smaller wave formations.",
