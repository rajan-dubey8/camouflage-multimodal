  "explanation": "The swan is a large, adult Mute Swan with distinct bright white plumage and an orange bill. It is highly conspicuous against the relatively darker and muted tones of the water background. The swan's pure white color and smooth feathery texture stand out strongly against the rippled, light grey-blue water, creating a high contrast difference. Swans are not known for camouflage; their white coloration makes them easily visible, which is often a characteristic of species that have few natural predators or use their size for deterrence."
