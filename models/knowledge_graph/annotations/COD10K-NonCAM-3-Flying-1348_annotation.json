  "object_name": "Bird perched on shrub",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a dense green shrub with fine, needle-like leaves. The background is soft and out of focus, showing a gradient of warm yellowish-brown and lighter tan tones, suggesting distant dry foliage or open ground under natural light.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bird exhibits no camouflage. Its striking orange breast and dark gray head create a strong visual contrast against the vibrant green foliage it is perched upon and the blurred yellowish-brown background. The smooth texture of its feathers also differs significantly from the spiky leaves of the shrub, making it highly conspicuous rather than blending into its environment."
