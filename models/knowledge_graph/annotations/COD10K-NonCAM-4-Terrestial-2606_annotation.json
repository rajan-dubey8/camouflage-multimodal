  "background_description": "The squirrel is situated on a light grey concrete or paved surface. Behind it, there is a low wall or raised ground composed of reddish-brown, rough-textured stones and earth, interspersed with some green foliage and small plants. Scattered dry leaves and debris are present on the ground.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits camouflage primarily through color blending. Its grayish-brown and reddish-brown fur coloration closely matches the earthy tones, reddish-brown stones, and tree bark often found in its natural habitat. While it stands out moderately against the lighter concrete foreground, its fur provides excellent color similarity with the darker, textured background of stones and earth, allowing it to blend effectively into such environments and reduce its visibility to predators."
