  "explanation": "The gorilla's dark fur is a natural adaptation for color blending, which aids in crypsis within the shaded and dense environments of its forest habitat. While its dark coloration allows it to merge with deep shadows common in such environments, in this specific well-lit image, especially against the lighter grey rocks and the brighter green foliage, the gorilla remains clearly visible. Its natural camouflage is present as an adaptation, but its effectiveness in this particular scene is moderate to low due to the lighting and immediate background elements."
