  "background_description": "The scene is a black and white image of a dense jungle or forest environment. The main subject is a large tree with a complex, interwoven root system that extends down and along massive, textured rocks. The rocks have a porous, rugged surface, covered in places by moss or small growth. In the background, there's a dense canopy of trees and foliage, appearing as a pattern of varying shades of grey and white due to the light filtering through. Vines and smaller branches hang down from the main tree and other unseen vegetation, adding to the cluttered, wild texture of the environment.",
