  "background_description": "The image captures a dense forest environment, looking upwards towards the canopy. A tall tree trunk, heavily covered in thick green moss and lichen, dominates the foreground. Its branches, also laden with moss, spread out. The background consists of a bright, clear blue sky peeking through the vibrant green foliage and interwoven branches of surrounding trees. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating areas of high contrast and bright highlights on the upper canopy.",
