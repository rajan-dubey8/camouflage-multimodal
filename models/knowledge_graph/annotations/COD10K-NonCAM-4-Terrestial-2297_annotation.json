  "explanation": "The white wolf is clearly visible and stands out against the dark, earthy tones of the forest background. Its light-colored fur provides very low color and texture similarity with the brown tree bark and green foliage, resulting in a high contrast difference. While white fur would offer excellent camouflage in a snowy environment, it offers no camouflage in this specific forest setting."
