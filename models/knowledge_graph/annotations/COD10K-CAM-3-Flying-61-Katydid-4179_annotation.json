  "background_description": "The background consists of a dense arrangement of lush green and variegated yellow-green leaves belonging to a shrub or bush. The leaves are broad, with visible veins and a somewhat waxy or smooth texture. Some darker, shaded areas are visible within the foliage, along with hints of brown branches.",

  "explanation": "The Katydid exhibits outstanding camouflage through a combination of mimicry and color blending. Its body, especially its large, flattened wings, is remarkably shaped and textured to resemble a natural leaf, complete with visible 'veins' that replicate leaf venation. The insect's deep green coloration perfectly matches the dominant green tones of the surrounding foliage. While some background leaves are variegated with yellow, the Katydid's primary features (shape, texture, and color) create a very low contrast with the green environment, allowing it to blend seamlessly and making it very difficult to spot."
