  "object_name": "Dramatic sunset landscape over a lake",
  "background_description": "The scene features a dramatic sky with heavy, dark clouds and a bright, golden sun low on the horizon, possibly setting or rising. Sunlight breaks through the clouds, illuminating parts of the sky and casting a strong, shimmering reflection on the dark surface of a lake or body of water in the midground. A visible rain shaft or virga descends from the clouds. The foreground and distant land areas are largely silhouetted, appearing very dark with indistinct trees and ground cover.",
