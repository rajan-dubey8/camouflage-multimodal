The rocks are dark, stratified, and show various shades of grey, blue, and black, with detailed, layered textures. Some parts of the rock near the waterline have reddish-brown and greenish-brown growth (likely algae or moss). The water is calm, deep blue-green, transitioning from clearer, lighter tones near the shore where submerged rocks are visible, to a smoother, darker blue further out.",
