  "explanation": "The Lionfish exhibits a disruptive pattern camouflage. Its bold, alternating reddish-brown and white stripes, combined with its elaborate, spiny, and feathery fins, serve to break up its body outline. This pattern and texture make it difficult for predators or prey to distinguish the fish's true shape against the similarly complex and textured coral reef environment. While the colors are striking, they are also common within a coral reef ecosystem, and the intricate fin structures closely mimic the branching textures of the surrounding coral, enhancing its ability to blend in by obscuring its form rather than disappearing entirely."
