The stems are covered with small, tightly clustered, yellowish-green buds or nascent flowers. The immediate background is dark and out of focus, showing more of the same plant structure.",

  "explanation": "The Katydid in this image does not exhibit effective camouflage against its environment. Its body is predominantly light brown and tan with prominent dark brown stripes and patterns, which contrast sharply with the muted grayish-green stems and yellowish-green buds of the plant it is resting on. The robust, segmented shape of the Katydid is also distinct from the slender, branching structure of the plant. Neither its color, pattern, nor shape allow it to blend into this specific background, making it quite visible."
