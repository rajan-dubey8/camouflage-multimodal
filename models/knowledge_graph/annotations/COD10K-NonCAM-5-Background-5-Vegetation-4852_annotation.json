  "background_description": "The image captures a forest or brush fire. The lower half is dominated by intense, bright orange and yellow flames, with thin, dark plant stems visible within the fire. Above the flames, dense, dark grey smoke billows upwards, partially obscuring the background. Silhouetted against the smoky sky are numerous dark, bare tree branches, some extending prominently across the frame. The overall atmosphere is dark, chaotic, and dramatic.",
