  "explanation": "The Alpine Chough's body is almost entirely black, with a bright yellow beak and vibrant orange legs. This coloration creates a stark visual contrast against the light grey and white pebbled background. There is no evidence of color blending, disruptive patterns, or mimicry that would help the bird blend into its surroundings. The bird's features stand out prominently, indicating an absence of camouflage for this particular scene."
