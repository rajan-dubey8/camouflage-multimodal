  "background_description": "The image features a rocky coastline, with the foreground dominated by numerous dark green, moss-covered boulders partially submerged in a smooth, misty-looking body of water, indicative of a long exposure. In the midground, a sandy beach area is visible, transitioning to a large hill in the background. This hill is densely covered with a mix of evergreen trees and deciduous trees displaying vibrant autumn colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The sky above is pale, suggesting either dawn, dusk, or an overcast condition.",
