  "background_description": "The image features a vast mountainous landscape under a heavily overcast, grey sky. Dense fog and low-lying clouds shroud the mid-ground, obscuring parts of the rugged, rocky peaks and valleys, with only the upper sections of closer mountains visible on the right. A distant peak can be seen faintly above the fog line. The foreground consists of rocky ground covered with patches of dry, yellowish-brown grass and moss, interspersed with grey-white stones and a faint, rocky path leading into the fog.",
