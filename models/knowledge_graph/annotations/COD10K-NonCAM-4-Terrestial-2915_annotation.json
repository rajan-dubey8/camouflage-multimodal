  "explanation": "The chipmunk exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending and disruptive patterns. Its fur features a blend of reddish-brown, tan, and greyish tones that closely match the colors of the dry soil and rocks in its environment. The distinctive dark and light stripes along its back and sides serve as a disruptive pattern, breaking up the animal's silhouette and making it difficult for predators to distinguish its form against the varied textures and shadows of the ground. The overall low contrast between the chipmunk and its surroundings, combined with its matching colors and patterns, allows it to blend seamlessly into the habitat."
