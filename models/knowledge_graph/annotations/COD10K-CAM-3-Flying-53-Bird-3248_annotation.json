  "explanation": "The birds' dark gray plumage shares some tonal qualities with the dark, bare branches of the dead tree, especially given the grayscale nature of the image. This provides a medium level of color similarity. However, their distinct avian shapes and relatively smooth feathery textures contrast significantly with the rough, gnarled, and angular textures of the branches (low texture similarity). Against the brighter sky, the birds are silhouetted, making their outlines very clear. Even against the darker branches, their distinct forms and lighter feather patches or head areas create enough contrast (medium contrast difference) to prevent them from blending seamlessly into the environment. They are clearly identifiable and stand out rather than disappearing into the tree."
