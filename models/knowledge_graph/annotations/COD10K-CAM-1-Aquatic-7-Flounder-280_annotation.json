  "explanation": "The Flounder in this image exhibits excellent camouflage. Its flattened body shape allows it to lie flush with the seabed. Its dorsal coloration and intricate patterns of lighter beige and off-white spots, interspersed with darker, smaller speckles, perfectly mimic the variegated texture and color of the sandy, shell-flecked bottom. This combination of color blending and pattern matching significantly reduces its visual contrast against the background, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from the surrounding environment. The overall effect is a highly effective blending with its natural habitat, demonstrating strong camouflage."
