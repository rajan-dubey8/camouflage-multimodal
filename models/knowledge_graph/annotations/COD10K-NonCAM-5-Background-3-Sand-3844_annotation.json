The foreground features a sandy beach with long-exposure streaks from receding waves, creating a smooth, warm brown texture. The middle ground is occupied by the ocean, with a gentle, foamy wave breaking on the shore, its surface reflecting the sky's light. In the background, a rugged rocky coastline rises, showcasing earthy tones of red-brown and grey, topped with dense green trees. The sky is filled with soft, scattered clouds, illuminated by golden and orange hues from the low sun.",
