  "explanation": "The Peacock butterfly's wings feature prominent and vibrant colors, including rich red/orange, black, and distinct 'eyespots' with blue, black, and white markings. These bold patterns and colors contrast sharply with the bright yellow dandelion flower it is resting on and the blurred green foliage in the background. This coloration is highly conspicuous and serves as a warning (aposematism) or a startle display to deter predators, rather than providing any form of concealment or camouflage. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning to hide within this environment."
