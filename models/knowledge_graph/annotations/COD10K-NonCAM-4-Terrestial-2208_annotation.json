  "explanation": "The rat exhibits effective color blending camouflage. Its brownish-grey fur closely matches the dark, muted tones of the weathered wooden surface it is perched on and the blurred, earthy-toned background. The texture of its fur also generally aligns with the rough, non-uniform textures found in its natural or urban environment, helping it to disappear into the surroundings and reduce its visibility to predators."
