  "background_description": "The scene depicts a serene beach at twilight or early night, illuminated by a full moon high in a dark blue sky. A dense forest covers a hill that borders the sandy shoreline. The water, likely a lake or ocean, shows a long exposure effect on the waves breaking gently on the shore, with a bright, elongated reflection of the moon stretching across its surface. The sand is dark and appears soft, with some faint vegetation visible near the base of the forest.",
