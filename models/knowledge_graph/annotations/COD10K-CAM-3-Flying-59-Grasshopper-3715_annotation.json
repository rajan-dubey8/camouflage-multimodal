  "explanation": "The grasshopper demonstrates excellent camouflage, primarily through color blending. Its body is a bright green, which almost perfectly matches the various shades of green present in the surrounding grass blades. The low contrast between the insect and its immediate environment makes it very difficult to distinguish from the foliage. The soft focus of the image further aids in obscuring its outline and specific textures, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the verdant background."
