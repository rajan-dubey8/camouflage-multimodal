  "explanation": "The goldfish exhibits vibrant orange, gold, and white coloration, which starkly contrasts with the dark green and blue background of the aquarium. Goldfish are domesticated fish bred for ornamental purposes, and their bright colors are designed to be conspicuous rather than to blend into their environment. Therefore, no camouflage mechanism is present; instead, the fish stands out prominently."
