  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of various green leaves and stems of a plant. In the foreground, there are several distinct leaves, some vibrant green and others with yellowish-green hues and brownish, slightly withered edges. A thin, dark brown stem runs horizontally through the image. The midground and background are composed of soft-focus, blurry green foliage with hints of darker, reddish tones, suggesting a dense natural environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "Mimicry",
  "explanation": "The butterfly demonstrates remarkable camouflage through mimicry of a dried or aging leaf. Its wings are a pale yellowish-green, very closely matching the color of the surrounding leaves that show signs of yellowing or browning at the edges. The intricate vein patterns on its folded wings perfectly resemble the venation found on a natural leaf, enhancing the illusion. Furthermore, its resting posture, hanging upside down, reinforces the appearance of a natural part of the plant, such as a detached or withered leaf. The combination of color, texture, and shape mimicry, along with low contrast against the immediate background, makes it extremely difficult to spot."
