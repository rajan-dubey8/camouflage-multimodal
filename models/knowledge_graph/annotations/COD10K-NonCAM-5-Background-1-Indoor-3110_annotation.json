  "background_description": "The image depicts a dimly lit living room interior. Walls are primarily a medium blue, with an angled ceiling and upper wall sections painted a lighter off-white or cream. There's significant use of light-toned wood for trim, a built-in entertainment unit housing a television, a corner cabinet, and a smaller open shelving unit. Furniture includes a large, beige upholstered sofa and a dark blue armchair. Lighting sources consist of a ceiling fan light, a track light fixture with multiple spotlights, and a table lamp, casting distinct shadows and highlighting various areas. Decorative elements include a large model sailboat in the foreground, a round mirror with a gold frame, and a small boat model displayed in a wooden box on the blue wall.",
