  "explanation": "The jewel bugs display vibrant, iridescent blue, purple, and orange-red patterns on their exoskeletons. These bright colors create a very high contrast against the green plant stems and leaves they are resting on. There is no blending of colors or textures with their environment; instead, their coloration makes them highly conspicuous. This suggests their coloring serves purposes other than camouflage, such as aposematism (warning coloration) or sexual display, rather than concealment."
