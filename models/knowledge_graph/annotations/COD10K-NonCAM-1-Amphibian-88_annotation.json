  "object_name": "Toad",
  "background_description": "Shallow freshwater with a sandy and pebbly bottom, possibly with some submerged detritus or leaf litter. The water depth appears minimal, consistent with an amphibian's typical habitat near the water's edge.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "A toad, identifiable as an amphibian with mottled brown and black bumpy skin, is clearly visible. Its earthy tones and texture offer some natural resemblance to a typical aquatic-adjacent substrate. According to the problem context, camouflage is considered absent for this dataset."
