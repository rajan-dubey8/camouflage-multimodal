  "explanation": "The bird's plumage is characterized by highly vibrant and iridescent blue and purple colors, along with bright yellow eyes. While its wings have some greenish tones, the overall vividness and strong primary colors of the bird create a high contrast against the blurry, mottled green, yellow, and purplish background. Such striking coloration is typically used for display or signaling rather than concealment, making the bird highly visible in its environment. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning to obscure its outline or presence."
