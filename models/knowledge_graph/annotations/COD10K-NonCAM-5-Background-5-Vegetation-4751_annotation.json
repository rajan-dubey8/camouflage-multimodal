  "background_description": "The image depicts a dark, dense forest environment with strong patches of sunlight illuminating various elements. Tree trunks and branches are heavily covered in thick, stringy moss or lichen, ranging in color from deep green to a lighter, almost glowing pale green where the sun hits directly. The background is a blurry expanse of shadowed trees and foliage, creating a deep, dark contrast to the sunlit areas. The overall texture is organic, fibrous, and somewhat chaotic due to the hanging moss.",
