  "explanation": "The warthog's body, primarily dark grey-brown with sparse, coarse hair and lighter bristles, significantly contrasts with the bright, lush green grassy background. There is a clear distinction in both color and texture between the animal and its immediate environment, making it highly visible. While warthogs possess coloration that blends well with dry savanna environments (dirt, dry grass, and shadows), this specific vibrant green setting does not offer any natural concealment for its typical appearance."
