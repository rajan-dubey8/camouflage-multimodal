  "explanation": "The leopard demonstrates effective camouflage in this image. Its characteristic spotted fur, consisting of black rosettes against a tawny, yellowish-brown base, is designed to break up its outline and blend with dappled light and shadow in wooded environments. While the primary background color is green from the leaves, the leopard's earthy tones and complex pattern align well with the browns of tree bark and the natural shadows inherent in such a setting. The dense green foliage in the foreground further enhances its concealment by obscuring parts of its body, making it difficult to discern its complete form. The contrast between the leopard's patterns and the background is effectively minimized by both its inherent coat design and the visual clutter of the environment, particularly the dappled sunlight and shadows that mimic its own spots and broken lines."
