A rocky coastline, light grey with patches of green vegetation and white foamy waves breaking against it, is visible on the left. The shallow waters reveal detailed underwater structures, including light sandy patches and darker areas indicative of coral reefs or rocky seabeds, creating a mottled texture beneath the surface. Further out, the water deepens to a rich blue with less visible detail.",
