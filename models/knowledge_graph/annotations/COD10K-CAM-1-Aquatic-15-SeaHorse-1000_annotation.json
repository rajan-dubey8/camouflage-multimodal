  "explanation": "The SeaHorse (specifically, a Pygmy Seahorse) exhibits exceptional camouflage. Its body coloration, which includes shades of pink, red, and pale white, perfectly matches the vibrant hues of the gorgonian coral it resides on. More remarkably, its entire body is covered in numerous bulbous, knobbly protuberances (tubercles) that precisely mimic the shape and texture of the coral's star-shaped polyps. This structural mimicry, combined with accurate color blending, makes the seahorse virtually indistinguishable from its environment. The irregular, bumpy outline of the seahorse completely disrupts its form, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the complex coral structure."
