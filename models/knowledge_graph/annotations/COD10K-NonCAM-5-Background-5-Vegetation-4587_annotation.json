  "background_description": "The image features a lush natural environment. In the foreground, there are large, gnarled tree roots and dark brown soil covered with scattered dry leaves and sparse green ground cover. Several large, fan-shaped palm fronds with deep green hues are prominent, intermingled with other dense green foliage. A large, thick tree branch with textured, light-colored bark extends across the upper part of the frame, providing a canopy effect. The overall scene is rich in textures and varying shades of green and brown.",
