  "explanation": "The Common Babbler exhibits color blending camouflage. Its dull brownish-grey plumage, with subtle streaking, allows it to naturally blend into its typical habitat, which often includes dry leaves, soil, tree bark, and general undergrowth. While the bird is positioned on a somewhat contrasting reddish pot, its overall coloration still harmonizes with the muted greens and browns of the natural, blurred background foliage, making it less conspicuous than if it were brightly colored. This cryptic coloration helps it avoid predators and remain undetected by prey."
