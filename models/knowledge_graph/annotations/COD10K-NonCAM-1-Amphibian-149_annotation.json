  "background_description": "The background consists of a dark, coarse, granular surface resembling asphalt or concrete in the foreground, transitioning to a blurry, darker green-tinged area further back, likely indicating vegetation or a distant structure under low light conditions. The immediate ground has varying shades of dark grey and brown with a rough texture.",

  "explanation": "The toad exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending and texture matching. Its mottled brown, grey, and olive-green skin tones closely match the dark, rough, gravel-like ground it is resting on. The bumpy, warty texture of its skin further helps it blend with the uneven surface of the ground, significantly reducing its contrast and making its outline less distinct from the immediate environment. This allows it to seamlessly integrate into its surroundings, making it difficult for predators or prey to spot."
