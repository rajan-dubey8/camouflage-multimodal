  "background_description": "The scene depicts a calm body of water (likely a fjord) with a snow-covered mountain range in the background under a cloudy sky. The water reflects the mountains and sky, showing soft blues, greys, and faint pink hues from the clouds. The mountains are rugged, covered in white snow at higher elevations and darker rock/vegetation at lower parts. A small, rocky island is visible in the middle distance, and some underwater features like rocks or algae can be seen through the clear water in the foreground.",
