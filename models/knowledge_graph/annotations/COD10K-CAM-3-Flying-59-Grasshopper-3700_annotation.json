  "explanation": "The grasshopper exhibits excellent camouflage. Its body color is a mottled brown and grey, almost perfectly matching the sandy soil and the small stones that make up its immediate environment. The rough, textured surface of its exoskeleton also mimics the granularity of the sand and pebbles. Darker markings on its wings and body further help to break up its outline, preventing it from appearing as a solid, distinct shape. The overall low contrast between the grasshopper and its surroundings makes it very difficult to spot at first glance, indicating effective color blending and pattern matching with its habitat."
