  "background_description": "The image displays a wide sandy beach at what appears to be sunrise or sunset. The foreground features textured, rippled sand with distinct shadows and highlights, suggesting a warm golden-orange hue. Towards the midground, the sand becomes smoother, leading to the ocean. The ocean surface is calm with gentle waves, reflecting the bright sunlight from the horizon. A distant coastline with some dark green vegetation or cliffs is visible on the left. The sky is a clear, deep blue, transitioning to a lighter, warmer tone near the horizon where the sun is low, casting a strong sunburst effect.",
