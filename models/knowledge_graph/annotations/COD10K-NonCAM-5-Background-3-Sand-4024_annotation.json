The ground is primarily composed of reddish-orange soil and fine gravel, extensively covered with scattered small to medium-sized irregular stones and pebbles, ranging in color from dark gray and brown to black. The texture of the ground is rough, granular, and stony, stretching uniformly towards a distant, flat horizon.",
