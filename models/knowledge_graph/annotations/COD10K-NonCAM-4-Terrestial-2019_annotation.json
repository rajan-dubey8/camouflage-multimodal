  "explanation": "The mouse exhibits camouflage primarily through color blending. Its dark greyish-brown fur closely matches the dark brown color of the wooden post it is sitting on. The rough texture of its fur also has a moderate similarity to the natural, coarse texture of the wood, further aiding concealment. This results in a low color and contrast difference between the mouse and its immediate background, making it less conspicuous, particularly if viewed in dimmer light or from a distance. While its distinct shape is still visible, the coloration significantly reduces its detectability against the wood."
