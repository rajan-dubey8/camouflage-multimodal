  "explanation": "The red squirrel exhibits camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-brown fur, while vibrant in this lighting, allows it to blend with the natural colors of its forest habitat, such as tree bark, fallen leaves (especially in autumn), and reddish soil. The log it is standing on has complementary brownish-green tones. However, the contrast against the blurred green background is still medium, and the texture of its fur does not mimic the rough bark or smooth leaves, making it moderately visible despite its adapted coloration. Its natural coloring provides a degree of concealment, particularly when it remains still in more varied or shadowed forest environments."
