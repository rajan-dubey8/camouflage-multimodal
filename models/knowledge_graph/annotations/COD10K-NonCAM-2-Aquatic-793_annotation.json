  "explanation": "The Longhorn Cowfish in the image displays a vibrant yellowish-green coloration with distinct white markings and a hexagonal scale pattern. This bright color highly contrasts with the dark blue and reddish-orange hues of the blurred underwater background. Its boxy shape and prominent horns also make it easily identifiable and do not blend with the surrounding environment's textures or forms. Therefore, no camouflage is present; the fish stands out clearly."
