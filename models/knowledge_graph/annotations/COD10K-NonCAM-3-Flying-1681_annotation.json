  "object_name": "Boat-tailed Grackle",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a weathered wooden railing with visible grain and light discoloration, likely from exposure to elements. The background behind the railing is a softly blurred, bright light blue, suggestive of either a clear sky or open water.",

  "explanation": "The bird's dark brown and black plumage, with a distinct lighter brown head, stands out significantly against the pale, weathered wooden railing and the bright, light blue background. There is no attempt at color matching or disruptive patterning that would help it blend into this specific environment. Its solid coloration and distinct outline make it highly visible."
