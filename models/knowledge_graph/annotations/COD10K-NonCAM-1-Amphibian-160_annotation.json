  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The toad demonstrates effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its mottled dark brown and grey skin, with various earthy tones, closely matches the color palette of the dry and green grass, and the shadowy ground in its immediate environment. Furthermore, the warty and irregular texture of its skin helps to break up its silhouette and create a visual resemblance to the uneven textures of the surrounding vegetation and soil, reducing its contrast against the background and making it difficult for predators to detect."
