  "explanation": "The Picasso Triggerfish (Rhinecanthus rectangulus) in the image displays vibrant and highly contrasting patterns of black, white, yellow, and blue stripes and patches. These prominent markings make the fish exceptionally conspicuous against the muted, sandy, and pebbly background. While the fish exhibits disruptive patterns, these patterns serve to draw attention rather than conceal, acting as a warning to potential predators or for species recognition, rather than blending with its immediate environment. Therefore, it is not camouflaged."
