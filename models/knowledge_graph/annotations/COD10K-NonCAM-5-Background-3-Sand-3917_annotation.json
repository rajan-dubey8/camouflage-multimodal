  "object_name": "Coastal rock formation",
  "background_description": "The scene features rugged, dark volcanic rock formations, including a prominent natural archway. The rocks exhibit a coarse, fractured texture with varying shades of dark grey, brown, and black, with some areas appearing lighter and more reddish-brown under direct sunlight. Sparse patches of dry, light green vegetation cling to the tops of the formations. Below the rocks, the ocean water is dark blue-green, with foamy white waves crashing against the base of the rock structures and scattered smaller boulders. The sky overhead is a clear, bright blue.",
