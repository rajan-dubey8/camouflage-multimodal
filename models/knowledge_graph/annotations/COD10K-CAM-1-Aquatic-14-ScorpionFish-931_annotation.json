  "explanation": "The ScorpionFish exhibits outstanding camouflage. Its body coloration is a mottled mix of browns, greys, and sandy tones that perfectly match the varied hues of the granular seabed. The skin texture is rough and irregular, with small protrusions that mimic the texture of the sand, small rocks, and debris, achieving excellent pattern matching. Furthermore, its irregular body shape and the way it lies flat on the sand disrupt its outline, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from the surrounding environment. The overall contrast difference between the fish and its background is very low, effectively concealing it. Even the eye, often a giveaway, is subtly blended into its textured head."
