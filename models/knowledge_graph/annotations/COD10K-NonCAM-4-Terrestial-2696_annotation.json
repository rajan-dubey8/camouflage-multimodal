  "explanation": "The image features two zebras, which inherently possess a disruptive pattern (black and white stripes) that serves as a form of camouflage. While the stripes are highly conspicuous up close and against the bright, featureless sky, their primary function in nature is to break up the animal's outline, especially when in a herd or in low light conditions (dawn/dusk). This makes it harder for predators to target an individual, judge their speed, or distinguish a single animal from the group. In this particular scene, against the brown and green grass and the bright sky, the zebras' high-contrast stripes do not effectively blend with the immediate environment's colors or textures, making them quite visible. However, as the striped pattern itself is a well-known biological camouflage mechanism (disruptive coloration), camouflage is considered present, but its effectiveness is low in this specific lighting and environmental context for human observation."
