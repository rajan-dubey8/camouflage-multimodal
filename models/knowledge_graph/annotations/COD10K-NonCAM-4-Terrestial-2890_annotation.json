  "explanation": "The Eastern Gray Squirrel exhibits natural camouflage through color blending and countershading. Its grey-brown fur, with lighter underside, allows it to blend with the muted tones of tree bark, branches, and the ground in its natural habitat. While the squirrel is clearly visible against the blurred green foliage in this specific image, its natural coloration is effective for reducing visibility against the overall forest environment, especially when moving or perched on a tree trunk or branch. The texture of its fur also somewhat mimics the rough surfaces of bark or stone."
