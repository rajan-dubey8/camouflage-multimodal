  "explanation": "The fish in the image, primarily bright orange and golden koi, are highly conspicuous against the background. Their vibrant colors stand out strongly against the muted, multi-colored pebbles and rocks on the aquarium floor. There is no resemblance in color or texture between the fish and their surroundings, leading to a high visual contrast and indicating a complete absence of camouflage. These ornamental fish are bred for their striking appearance, not for blending into an environment."
