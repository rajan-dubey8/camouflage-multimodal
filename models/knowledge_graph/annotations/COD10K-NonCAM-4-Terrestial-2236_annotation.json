  "background_description": "The lioness is resting at the base of a large tree with dark, textured bark and exposed roots. The ground is composed of dry, earthy soil, scattered leaves, and some sparse green vegetation. In the background, there's dappled sunlight filtering through dense green foliage and branches, creating a mix of bright and shadowed areas. The dominant colors are earthy browns, grays, and greens.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The lioness exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Her tawny coat color closely matches the dry earth, exposed tree roots, and sun-dappled patches of the surrounding environment. The interplay of strong shadows and bright sunlight across her body, as she rests under the tree, also creates a disruptive effect, helping to break up her outline and make her less distinct against the varied background of dark tree bark, light soil, and green foliage. This natural coloration and the environmental lighting conditions significantly reduce her visibility."
