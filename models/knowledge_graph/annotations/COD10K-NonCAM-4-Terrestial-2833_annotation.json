  "explanation": "The Dik-dik displays effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its short, tan-brown fur closely matches the predominant colors of the dry, dusty, and arid background environment. This high color similarity, combined with a relatively low contrast difference against its surroundings, helps the animal blend into its natural habitat, making it harder for predators to spot. While the texture of its fur is distinct from the grainy ground, the overall muted tones and lack of strong patterns contribute to its ability to visually merge with the environment."
