  "explanation": "The Black-backed Jackal displays effective camouflage through color blending with its environment. Its fur, which is predominantly sandy-brown and reddish-tan, closely matches the dry soil and withered grass in the background. This high color similarity significantly reduces its visibility against the warm, earthy tones of the landscape. While the black saddle on its back offers some contrast, the primary body coloration allows the jackal to blend in seamlessly with the arid savanna, aiding in both hunting and evading detection by predators."
