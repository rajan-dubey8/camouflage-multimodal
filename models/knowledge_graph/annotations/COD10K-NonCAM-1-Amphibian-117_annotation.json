  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The toad's mottled brown and greenish-brown coloration, along with its bumpy, textured skin, allows it to blend effectively with the earthy tones, shadows, and the less vibrant parts of the vegetation in the background. While the bright green grass provides some contrast, the toad's overall hue and texture mimic the ground and detritus of its natural habitat, making it less conspicuous to predators and prey. This demonstrates effective color blending as a camouflage mechanism."
