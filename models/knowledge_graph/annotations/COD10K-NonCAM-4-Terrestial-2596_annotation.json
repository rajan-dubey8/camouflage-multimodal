  "explanation": "The hares exhibit effective camouflage through color blending. Their fur, which is a mottled mix of browns, tans, and grays, closely matches the hues of the surrounding dry and green grass. This coloration helps them blend seamlessly into their natural environment, reducing their visibility to predators by minimizing contrast and allowing them to merge with the background. The textured fur also complements the varied texture of the grass."
