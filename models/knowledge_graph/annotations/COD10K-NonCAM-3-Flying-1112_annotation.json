  "explanation": "The Bald Eagle's distinct features, including its bright white head and tail (not fully visible but implied by the head), dark brown body, and prominent yellow beak, create a significant contrast against the blurred green foliage and grass background. Its coloration is iconic and serves as species identification rather than camouflage for blending into this type of environment. The eagle is clearly visible and easily distinguishable from its surroundings."
