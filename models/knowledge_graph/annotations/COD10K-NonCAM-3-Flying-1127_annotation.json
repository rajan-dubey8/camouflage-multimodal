  "object_name": "Bird on fence",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a prominent rusted green metal chain-link fence on which the bird is perched. Behind the bird, the scene is highly blurred, showing soft patches of light green (likely foliage) and muted grays/whites, indicating a distant, out-of-focus environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bird's gray and white plumage contrasts significantly with the artificial green of the metal fence it is sitting on. While these colors could offer some degree of concealment in a natural environment like tree bark or dry branches, in this specific context, the bird stands out clearly against the brightly lit fence and the blurred background. There is no active attempt at mimicry, disruptive patterning, or color blending with the immediate surroundings that would suggest camouflage."
