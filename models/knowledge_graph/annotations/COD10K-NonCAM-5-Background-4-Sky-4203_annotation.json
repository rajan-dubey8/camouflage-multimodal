  "background_description": "The scene presents a serene rural landscape under an overcast sky. A line of tall, dark green trees forms a prominent border along the mid-ground. In front of the trees, there's a vibrant field of yellow flowers, likely rapeseed, transitioning to a strip of green grass by the water's edge. To the right, a calm river or canal reflects the soft light of the sky. In the far background, multiple layers of mountains fade into a hazy, blue-grey distance. The sky above is largely covered with thin, scattered stratocumulus clouds.",
