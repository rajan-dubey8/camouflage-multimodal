  "explanation": "The cheetah exhibits effective camouflage. Its golden-tan fur closely matches the dry, yellow-brown savanna grass, providing excellent color blending. The distinctive black spots on its coat act as a disruptive pattern, breaking up the animal's natural outline and making it difficult for prey to distinguish its form against the varied textures and shadows of the tall grass and scattered shrubs. This allows the cheetah to remain hidden while stalking prey."
