  "object_name": "Lizard",
  "background_description": "The lizard is situated on a dense, vibrant green bush composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaves. Many of these leaves show a lighter, almost yellow-green hue, possibly indicating new growth or variegation, creating a varied green texture. The background behind the bush is heavily blurred, appearing as a soft, light brown or tan color, suggesting dry earth or distant, out-of-focus elements.",

  "contrast_difference": "low",
  "camouflage_score": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The lizard demonstrates effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its head and the front portion of its body are a vibrant green, which perfectly matches the dominant green color of the small leaves on the bush it is resting upon. This allows it to seamlessly integrate with the foliage, making it difficult for predators or prey to spot. While its hindquarters and tail transition to a brownish-grey, which offers slightly less blending with the green leaves, the overall impression is one of strong concealment due to the high color similarity with its immediate surroundings. The contrast difference between the lizard and the bush is low, further enhancing its camouflage, although the scaly texture of the lizard is distinct from the smooth leaves, resulting in low texture similarity."
