  "background_description": "The image showcases a dense canopy of deciduous trees from a low angle, looking upwards towards the sky. The leaves display a vibrant mix of green, yellow, and some orange hues, suggesting either late summer or early autumn. Strong sunlight pierces through the foliage, creating a bright starburst effect and lens flare, illuminating the leaves and casting dappled light. Visible tree branches and the main trunk are also present beneath the dense leaf cover.",
