  "object_name": "Snake",
  "background_description": "The snake is coiled on a dry, rough, grey-brown tree branch. The background consists of a blurred forest floor with dry leaves, twigs, dirt, and sparse patches of green vegetation, dominated by earthy tones of brown and grey.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Pattern matching / Shape disruption",
  "explanation": "The snake exhibits excellent camouflage through a combination of color blending and pattern matching. Its grey-brown body with darker blotches perfectly mimics the color and texture of the dry tree branch it is coiled on, as well as the cluttered, earthy tones of the forest floor visible in the background. The intricate patterns on its skin break up its outline, making it difficult to distinguish from the rough bark and surrounding debris. The overall low contrast between the snake and its environment further enhances its ability to blend in seamlessly."
