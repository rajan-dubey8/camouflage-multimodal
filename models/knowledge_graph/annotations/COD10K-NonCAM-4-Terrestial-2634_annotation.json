  "explanation": "The African Buffalo's large, dark grey/black body stands out prominently against the lighter green and brown savanna vegetation. Its dark coloration and massive size create a high contrast with the background, making it easily visible. This species does not rely on camouflage for defense; rather, its primary defense mechanisms are its formidable size, aggressive nature, and living in large herds."
