  "explanation": "The bird's upper plumage is a distinct grey-brown, which contrasts significantly with the dominant bright white snow in the background. While its white belly could offer some blending if viewed from below against snow, the overall presentation of the bird against the bright snow makes it quite conspicuous. Its feathery texture is also distinct from the granular texture of the snow. Therefore, it is not effectively camouflaged in this snowy environment."
