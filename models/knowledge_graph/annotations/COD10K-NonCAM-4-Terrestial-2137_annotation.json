  "explanation": "Two domestic cats are visible in a natural setting of green grass and dry reeds. Their predominantly white and black fur creates a strong color and luminance contrast against the green foliage and golden-brown dry grass, making them highly visible. There is no indication of color blending, disruptive patterns, or mimicry that would aid in concealing them within this environment. The cats stand out clearly."
