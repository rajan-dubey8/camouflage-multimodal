  "background_description": "The image features a striking sunset sky dominating the upper half. On the left, vibrant, fiery orange and red clouds are illuminated by the setting sun, creating a warm and dynamic texture. These clouds transition towards the right into darker, heavy grey and bluish-purple storm clouds, indicating a varied atmospheric condition. Below the horizon, a residential area is visible, characterized by numerous houses with predominantly red-tiled roofs, interspersed with some darker roofs and green trees. In the far background, a large hill covered in dense green vegetation rises, contrasting with the man-made structures and the dramatic sky.",
