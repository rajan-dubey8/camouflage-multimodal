  "object_name": "Damselfly",
  "background_description": "The damselfly is perched on vibrant yellow flowers with orange stamens and green stems. The background is a soft, out-of-focus blur of pastel pink, orange, and white colors, creating a gentle gradient.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The damselfly, with its iridescent metallic green and blue body and wings covered in water droplets, stands out distinctly against the bright yellow flowers it is perched upon and the soft, blurry pastel background. Its vibrant colors and intricate details create a high contrast with its immediate environment, making it clearly visible rather than camouflaged. There is no significant color blending or texture mimicry with the flowers, stems, or the background that would suggest camouflage."
