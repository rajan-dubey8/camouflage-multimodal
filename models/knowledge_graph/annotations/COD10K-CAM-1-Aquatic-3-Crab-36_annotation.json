  "background_description": "The background consists of light-colored, granular sand with varying shades of beige, off-white, and light grey. There are small depressions and subtle undulations in the sand, creating areas of shadow and light, indicating an uneven surface. The texture is coarse and crystalline due to individual sand grains, particularly visible in direct sunlight.",

  "explanation": "The crab demonstrates effective camouflage by highly matching the color and texture of its sandy environment. Its carapace and legs are a light, speckled beige-grey, very similar to the color palette of the sand grains. The mottled pattern on its body further helps to break up its outline and mimics the granular texture of the sand, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The overall low contrast between the crab and the sand, combined with the excellent color and pattern matching, allows it to blend in effectively."
