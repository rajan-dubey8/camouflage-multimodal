In the foreground and mid-ground, there is a prominent piece of weathered, dead wood or a dried-up tree stump partially buried in the sand, casting a distinct shadow. Further in the distance, more sand dunes are visible, along with some sparse, low-lying green shrubs and additional pieces of dead vegetation.",
