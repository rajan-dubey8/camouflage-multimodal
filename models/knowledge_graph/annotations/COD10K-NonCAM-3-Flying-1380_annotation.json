  "object_name": "Common Starling",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a light brown, gnarled tree branch or log with visible wood grain and textured bark. The background behind the bird is a softly blurred, muted greyish-brown, suggesting distant foliage or a natural outdoor setting.",

  "explanation": "The Common Starling's dark, iridescent plumage, speckled with white spots, and its bright pinkish-red legs stand out distinctly against the light brown, textured tree branch and the muted grey-brown background. There is a clear contrast in color and value between the bird and its immediate environment, indicating no significant attempt at camouflage in this particular scene. Its patterns and colors do not blend with the light-colored, textured wood."
