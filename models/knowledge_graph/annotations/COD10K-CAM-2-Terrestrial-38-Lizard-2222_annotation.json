  "background_description": "The background consists of a sandy, somewhat barren terrain. In the mid-ground and foreground, there are various grey, rough-textured rocks of different sizes, and light grey sandy ground. The far background appears to be a blurry, yellowish-brown sandy or dry earth area, with a dark, snake-like shape partially visible.",

  "explanation": "The lizard exhibits effective camouflage due to its greyish coloration, which closely matches the grey rocks and light grey sandy ground it is situated upon. Its scaly and somewhat rugged skin texture also closely resembles the rough, uneven surfaces of the surrounding rocks, contributing significantly to its blending. The low contrast between the lizard and its immediate rocky environment makes it difficult to distinguish its form, allowing it to merge with the geological features. While the background is a different yellowish hue, the lizard is perfectly integrated into its immediate rocky context."
