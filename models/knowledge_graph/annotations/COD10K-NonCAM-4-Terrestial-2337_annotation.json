  "explanation": "The hyena's fur, primarily a mix of earthy browns, grays, and darker streaks/spots, is naturally adapted for camouflage in its typical savanna and dry grassland habitats. This coloration usually aids in blending with dry vegetation, dirt, and shadows, allowing it to approach prey undetected or remain hidden. In this specific image, however, the background is composed of vibrant, lush green grass. While the hyena's natural coat is a form of camouflage (color blending and disruptive patterns), its effectiveness is significantly reduced against this particular bright green environment, leading to a low color and texture similarity, and making the animal quite visible."
