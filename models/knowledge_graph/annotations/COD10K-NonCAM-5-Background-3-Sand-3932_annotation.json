  "background_description": "The image captures a serene tropical beach scene during what appears to be sunrise or sunset. The foreground features the edge of the ocean with waves gently breaking on the wet, dark sand, creating a line of white foam. The sand is fine-grained and reflects the ambient light. In the midground, the ocean extends with glints of light on its surface. The background showcases a coastline lined with numerous palm trees, silhouetted against a hazy, soft golden-grey sky. Distant landforms or rocky outcrops are faintly visible on the left horizon. The overall lighting is muted and warm.",
