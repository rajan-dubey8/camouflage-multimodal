  "explanation": "A clearly visible toad, identifiable by its warty skin and large eyes, is resting on green leaves and grass. Its mottled brown and earthy coloration, while natural for a toad, provides a low color and texture similarity against the vibrant green foliage, making it stand out clearly. No camouflage behavior or appearance is present."
