  "explanation": "The Bontebok is clearly visible against the dry grassland background. Its distinctive coloration, featuring a dark brown body, a prominent white blaze on its face, and a large white patch on its hindquarters, creates a high contrast with the muted brown and tan hues of the surrounding grass and soil. The animal's markings are designed for display and species recognition rather than concealment in this particular environment, causing it to stand out significantly. There is no evidence of color blending, disruptive patterns, or mimicry that would aid in camouflage."
