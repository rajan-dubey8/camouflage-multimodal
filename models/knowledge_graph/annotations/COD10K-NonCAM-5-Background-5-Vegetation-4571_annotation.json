In the mid-ground, there is a golden-hued stone wall, behind which are various evergreen shrubs, smaller leafless trees, and a house partially visible with warm yellow-orange walls. The lighting suggests a low sun, casting a warm glow on the scene.",

Therefore, the concept of camouflage for an organism is not applicable."
