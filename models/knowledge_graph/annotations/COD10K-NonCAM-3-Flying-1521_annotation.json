  "object_name": "Bird on a bare tree branch",
  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of a clear, bright blue sky. Numerous bare, dark brown tree branches crisscross the sky, with some green leaves visible in the lower left portion of the image.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bird's dark, almost black silhouette stands in stark contrast against the bright, clear blue sky. Despite being perched among bare branches, its solid form and dark coloration do not blend with the linear structure and dark tones of the branches, nor with the vibrant blue of the sky. The high contrast makes the bird highly visible and easily detectable, indicating no camouflage."
