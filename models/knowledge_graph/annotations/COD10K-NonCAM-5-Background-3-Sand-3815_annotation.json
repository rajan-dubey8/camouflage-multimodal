  "object_name": "Fossiliferous rock surface",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a rough, mottled grey rock surface, likely limestone, embedded with numerous fossilized shells and fragments. These fossils range in color from darker grey to yellowish-brown, creating an irregular pattern and varied texture across the surface. The material appears stony and worn, with visible granular and coarse textures.",

  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The image displays a close-up of a fossiliferous rock surface, showing geological features and embedded ancient organisms (fossils), not a living organism. Since no living animal, insect, or fish is present in the image, the concept of camouflage does not apply. Therefore, camouflage presence is explicitly set to 'No Camouflage', and related camouflage metrics are set to 'none' or '0.0' as per the rules."
