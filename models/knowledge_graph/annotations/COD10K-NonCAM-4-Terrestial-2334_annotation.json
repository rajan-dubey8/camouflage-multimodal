  "explanation": "The ibex display effective camouflage through color blending with their natural habitat. Their fur ranges from reddish-brown to grayish-brown, perfectly matching the colors of the dry grasses, soil, and rocks on the mountain slope. The texture of their fur, particularly on the adult animals, has a rugged, slightly matted appearance that mimics the rough surfaces of the rocks and the tussocks of grass. This high color and texture similarity, along with a low contrast difference against the immediate terrain, allows them to blend in well, making them harder for predators to spot in this rocky, arid environment."
