  "explanation": "The butterfly's vibrant orange wings with distinct black spots create a high contrast against both the grey stone and the green foliage/brown soil of the background. Its bright coloration makes it highly visible and does not blend into the surroundings. This coloring is likely a form of aposematism or a visual display rather than camouflage for concealment."
