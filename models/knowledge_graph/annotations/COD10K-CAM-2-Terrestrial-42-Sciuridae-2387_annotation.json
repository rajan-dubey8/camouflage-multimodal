The bark exhibits a complex texture of ridges and valleys, with colors ranging from light greyish-brown to darker browns and almost black in the deeper crevices, particularly in the vertical grooves.",

  "explanation": "The Sciuridae (squirrel) in the image does not blend effectively with its environment. While its general body coloration shares some greyish-brown tones with the tree bark, its distinctive light-colored stripes create a strong visual contrast against both its own darker fur and the varying shades and textures of the bark. The smooth texture of its fur also differs significantly from the rugged, deeply ridged bark. Although the squirrel is positioned against a darker crevice, the prominent stripes make its shape and pattern easily discernible, preventing effective camouflage."
