  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits natural camouflage through its fur coloration, which features shades of brown, grey, and reddish-brown. These colors allow it to blend moderately well with the earthy tones of the soil and dried vegetation, as well as the varied greens of the surrounding plants. While its form is clearly discernible, the color and texture similarities reduce its overall contrast with the natural background, aiding in concealment from predators."
