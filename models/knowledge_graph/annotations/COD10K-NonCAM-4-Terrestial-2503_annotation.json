  "explanation": "The lioness exhibits effective natural camouflage primarily through 'Color blending'. Its tawny, golden-brown fur coloration closely matches the dry grasses, sandy terrain, and earthy tones typical of its savanna habitat. While the immediate background in this specific image contains some green foliage, the overall color palette of the lioness still aligns well with the broader environmental colors it uses for concealment. The natural fur pattern and color help it to blend into the surroundings, aiding in hunting and avoiding detection."
