  "object_name": "Cloudy sky with partial sun",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a expansive sky with a mix of cloud types. There are large, diffuse patches of light grey and white clouds, with some wispy cirrus-like formations. A bright, obscured sun is visible through a denser patch of clouds in the upper left, casting a strong glare. Patches of clear, deep blue sky are visible between the clouds, particularly towards the bottom and right. At the bottom edge, dark silhouettes of buildings and a streetlight are visible.",

  "explanation": "The image exclusively depicts an environmental scene, primarily consisting of a cloudy sky with the sun peeking through, along with parts of buildings and streetlights at the edges. No organisms (animals, insects, or fish) are present or discernible within the frame. Therefore, the concept of camouflage is not applicable."
