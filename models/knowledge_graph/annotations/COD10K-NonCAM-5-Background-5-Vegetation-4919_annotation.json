Adjacent to the sidewalk is a narrow border of dark green, thin, grass-like plants, followed by a dense bed of leafy green shrubs. The shrubbery exhibits varying shades of green, with brighter areas illuminated by sunlight and darker areas in shadow. Two tree trunks with rough, brown bark emerge from within the shrubbery. In the background, a dark grey asphalt road and a black metal barrier with yellow stripes are visible.",
