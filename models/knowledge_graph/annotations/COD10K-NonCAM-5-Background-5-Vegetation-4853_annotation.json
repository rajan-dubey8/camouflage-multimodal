  "background_description": "The scene depicts a wildfire burning through dry vegetation on the ground. A large, dark-silhouetted deciduous tree with bare branches stands prominently in the center, extending towards a clear light blue sky. Smoke, light blue-grey, rises from the burning ground, partially obscuring the background foliage. Flames are visible at the base of the vegetation, creating a stark contrast against the dark trees and pale sky/smoke.",
