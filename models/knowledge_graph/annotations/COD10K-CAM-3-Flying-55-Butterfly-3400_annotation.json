  "explanation": "The butterfly exhibits exceptional camouflage by perfectly mimicking a dried, fallen leaf. Its wings, when closed, adopt an irregular, jagged shape with a small projection resembling a leaf stem. The underside of the wings displays a mottled pattern of various browns, tans, and reddish-browns, precisely matching the colors of the surrounding leaf litter. The patterns on its wings also mimic leaf veins and discolored patches, further enhancing the illusion of a decaying leaf. This combination of color blending, pattern matching, and highly effective shape mimicry makes it extremely difficult to distinguish the butterfly from its environment."
