  "background_description": "The image displays a sandy terrain characterized by numerous wind-blown ripples creating wavy patterns across the surface. The sand is a warm golden-brown color, illuminated by low-angle sunlight, casting long, soft shadows that emphasize the texture and undulations of the dunes. Sparse clumps of dry and some greenish vegetation are scattered across the sand, providing minor points of interest against the otherwise uniform sandy backdrop.",
