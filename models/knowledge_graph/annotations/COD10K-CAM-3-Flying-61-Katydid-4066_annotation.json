  "background_description": "The background is a vibrant, natural green environment dominated by various leaves and slender branches. Some leaves are in sharp focus, revealing veins and textures, while others are blurred, creating a soft, lush backdrop. The lighting suggests a bright, possibly overcast or dappled outdoor setting, illuminating the foliage with a fresh green hue. A slender brown stem runs vertically in the mid-ground.",

  "camouflage_type": "Mimicry / Color blending / Pattern matching",
  "explanation": "The Katydid exhibits exceptional camouflage through a combination of mimicry, color blending, and pattern matching. Its body, particularly the broad, flattened wings, is shaped almost identically to a leaf, complete with visible 'veins' that resemble leaf venation. The primary color is a vibrant green that perfectly matches the surrounding healthy foliage. Furthermore, the dark spots scattered across its wings convincingly mimic natural imperfections, insect bites, or fungal spots often found on real leaves, further disrupting its outline and making it appear as just another part of the plant. The overall low contrast with the background enhances its ability to blend seamlessly into the leafy environment, making it incredibly difficult for predators to spot."
