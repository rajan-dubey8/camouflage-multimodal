  "background_description": "The background is an out-of-focus, murky greenish-brown aquatic environment. It appears to contain indistinct blurred green patches, suggestive of underwater plant life or algae, and is filled with numerous small, bright specks that could be particulate matter, sediment, or tiny air bubbles suspended in the water.",

  "explanation": "The seahorse exhibits strong camouflage, primarily through mimicry and color blending. Its golden-brown coloration closely matches the murky, brownish-green tones of the aquatic background, providing high color similarity. Furthermore, its body is covered in numerous small bumps and textured protuberances, which allow it to blend seamlessly with rough or textured marine structures such as coral, sponges, or seaweed, effectively mimicking these elements. The overall low contrast difference between the seahorse and its environment further enhances its ability to remain undetected."
