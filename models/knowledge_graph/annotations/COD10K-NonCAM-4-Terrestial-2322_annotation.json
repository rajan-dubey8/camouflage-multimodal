  "explanation": "The Arctic fox exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its grayish-brown and creamy fur, characteristic of its summer coat, closely matches the muted greens, browns, and grays of the mossy, rocky, and earthy tundra environment. This coloration helps reduce its contrast and break up its outline against this specific backdrop, making it less conspicuous to both prey and predators, despite being clearly visible in the foreground."
