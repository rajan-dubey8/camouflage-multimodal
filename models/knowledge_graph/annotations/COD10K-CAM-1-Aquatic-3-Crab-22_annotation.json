  "background_description": "The background consists of fine-grained beach sand, appearing mostly in shades of light brown and tan, with scattered darker individual grains. The texture is granular and uneven, creating a somewhat mottled appearance. The sand surface is relatively flat with minor undulations.",

  "explanation": "The crab exhibits excellent camouflage against the sandy beach environment. Its pale, light brown, and somewhat translucent body coloration closely matches the dominant hues of the sand, which is a mix of light tan and brown grains. The speckled markings and subtle variations in its carapace and legs mimic the varied texture and individual darker grains present in the sand. This high degree of color and texture similarity, combined with a very low contrast difference, makes the crab difficult to distinguish from its immediate surroundings, effectively achieving a high level of concealment through both color blending and pattern matching."
