  "background_description": "The image captures a serene coastal landscape at sunset. The sky is dominated by a hazy, warm orange-brown hue, with a brilliantly luminous, white sun positioned centrally. Below the horizon, distant landmasses appear as dark, rugged silhouettes, covered with what looks like dense vegetation or hills. The ocean surface displays gentle waves, with white foam cresting as they break closer to the shore. The foreground is a sandy beach, wet from the receding tide, perfectly reflecting the golden and orange light of the setting sun.",
