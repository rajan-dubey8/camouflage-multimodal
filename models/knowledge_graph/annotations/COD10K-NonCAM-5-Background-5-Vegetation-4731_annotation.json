  "background_description": "The image features a dense canopy of green fern fronds, primarily 'Sword Fern' (Polystichum munitum) with their distinctive pinnate leaves. The fronds display various shades of green, from vibrant lighter greens in the foreground to darker, more muted greens in the background, suggesting depth and overlapping foliage. In the upper left corner, hints of moss-covered tree trunks or large branches are visible, adding textural variation with their rough, earthy appearance amidst the smooth, leafy ferns. The overall scene is lush, damp, and indicative of a temperate forest undergrowth.",
