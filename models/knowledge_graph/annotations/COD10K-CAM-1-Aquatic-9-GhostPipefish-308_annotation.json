  "camouflage_type": "Mimicry",
  "explanation": "The GhostPipefish demonstrates exceptional camouflage through a combination of mimicry, color blending, and shape disruption. Its large, leaf-like dorsal and caudal fins are a vibrant green, perfectly matching the color and veined texture of the surrounding aquatic plants. The elongated body, which is a reddish-brown/tan color, has irregular protrusions and extensions that mimic a decaying plant stem or other organic detritus commonly found within dense plant growth. This effective imitation of both live and decaying plant matter, combined with the lack of strong contrast, makes the organism incredibly difficult to spot and distinguishes it as a master of disguise in its environment."
