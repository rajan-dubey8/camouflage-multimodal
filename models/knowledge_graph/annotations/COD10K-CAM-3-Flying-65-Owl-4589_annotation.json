  "explanation": "The owl exhibits excellent camouflage against the tree bark. Its greyish-brown plumage, mottled with lighter and darker streaks, perfectly mimics the color and rough texture of the tree branches it is perched on. The vertical feather patterns resemble the fissures and patterns found in bark, leading to a high degree of color and texture similarity. The ear tufts and overall mottled appearance also contribute to shape disruption, breaking up the bird's distinct outline. While the bright yellow eyes provide a point of contrast, the rest of the body blends almost seamlessly, making the owl very difficult to spot at first glance."
