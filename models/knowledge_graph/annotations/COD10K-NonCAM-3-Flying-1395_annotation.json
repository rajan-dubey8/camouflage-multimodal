  "explanation": "The Blue Jay exhibits striking bright blue, white, and black plumage which creates a high contrast against the muted browns, grays, and beiges of the bare tree branches and trunks in the background. Its vibrant coloration does not blend with the environment; instead, it makes the bird highly conspicuous and easily detectable. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
