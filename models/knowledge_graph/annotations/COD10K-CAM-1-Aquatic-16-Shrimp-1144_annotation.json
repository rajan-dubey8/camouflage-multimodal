  "background_description": "The background consists of a soft, light beige to off-white surface, likely a soft coral or anemone. It exhibits gentle, undulating folds and subtle vertical striations or ridges, creating areas of varying light and shadow that add to its textured appearance.",

  "explanation": "The shrimp exhibits effective camouflage primarily through its translucent body. This transparency allows it to largely take on the color and light qualities of the light beige/off-white background, making its form difficult to discern against the soft coral or anemone. While specific features such as its dark eyes, the purple coloration on its limb joints, and its brownish antennae create some contrast and are visible upon closer inspection, the overall transparency significantly reduces its detectability and helps it blend into its environment."
