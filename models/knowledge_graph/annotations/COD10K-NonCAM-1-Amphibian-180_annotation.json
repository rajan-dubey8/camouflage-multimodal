  "explanation": "The image clearly shows a toad, an amphibian, held in human hands. Its mottled brown and green skin stands out distinctly against the human skin and the dark, out-of-focus background. There is no camouflage present, as the animal's colors and textures do not blend with its immediate, non-aquatic surroundings."
