  "background_description": "The background consists of a large, rough-textured grey rock wall. In the mid-ground, there is a dark brown, wet, and weathered log with visible wood grain.

  "explanation": "While polar bears are naturally camouflaged in snowy, icy environments, in this particular image, the bear's light, off-white fur contrasts sharply with the dominant dark grey rocks and the dark brown log. Its presence is clearly visible, making camouflage ineffective in this specific setting."
