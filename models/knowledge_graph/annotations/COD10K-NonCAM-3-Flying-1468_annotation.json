  "object_name": "Butterfly",
  "background_description": "The butterfly is perched on a cluster of bright red-orange flowers with slender, reddish stamens. The immediate background is a soft, out-of-focus blur of green and muted grey/pink hues, suggesting distant foliage and ambient light.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The butterfly exhibits bright orange wings with prominent black veins and white spots, outlined with a distinct black border. These colors and patterns create a high contrast against both the red-orange flower it is resting on and the blurred green and grey background. Its vibrant appearance makes it highly conspicuous, indicating a lack of camouflage. Such bold coloration is often associated with aposematism (warning coloration) rather than concealment."
