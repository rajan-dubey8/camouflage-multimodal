  "background_description": "The background is an underwater scene depicting a shallow seabed. It primarily consists of light yellowish-tan sand, clearly sculpted into undulating ripples by water currents. Interspersed throughout the sandy bottom are various sized pebbles and larger rocks, which exhibit a range of colors from light grey to darker brown and greenish hues. Small fragments of dark, stringy organic debris, likely algae or decaying plant matter, are also visible on the sand surface.",
