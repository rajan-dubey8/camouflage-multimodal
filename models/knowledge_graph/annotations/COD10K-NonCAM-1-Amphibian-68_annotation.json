  "explanation": "A toad is distinctly visible on a pebbly, earthy bank. Its mottled brown and grey coloration, along with its rough skin texture, provides a natural blend with the surrounding ground, but it is clearly observable and not camouflaged. As an amphibian, the toad is associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, even when observed on the terrestrial edges of such habitats."
