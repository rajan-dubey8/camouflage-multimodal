  "explanation": "The two wild pigs are clearly visible against the natural background. Their dark grey/black coloration creates a distinct contrast with the lighter, muted grey-brown and sparse green ground, making them easily discernible. There is no significant color blending, disruptive patterning, or mimicry that would suggest active camouflage. Their silhouettes are prominent, and they do not blend into their surroundings."
