  "background_description": "The image features an abstract depiction of a beach and ocean, characterized by strong horizontal motion blur. The scene is divided into distinct horizontal bands: a solid blue sky at the top, followed by various shades of blue and turquoise representing the ocean. A prominent horizontal white streak indicates a breaking wave or a foam line in the water. The bottom portion of the image is a light sandy beige, representing the beach. The blur creates a smooth, painterly effect, with textures appearing as elongated horizontal streaks.",
