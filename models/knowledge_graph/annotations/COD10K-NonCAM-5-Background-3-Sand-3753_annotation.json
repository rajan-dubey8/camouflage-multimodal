It features a wide sandy beach stretching towards the horizon, meeting a choppy ocean with distinct white-capped waves. On the left side, a dense bank of dune grass creates a textured foreground. The sky is filled with numerous dramatic clouds. In the middle distance, a lone bench sits on the wet sand, and closer to the foreground, a large bin is partially buried in the sand.",
