  "background_description": "The background consists of a sandy seafloor in the foreground, characterized by fine, light-colored grains and scattered tiny shell fragments. Behind the seahorse, there are blurred green aquatic plants or seagrass, along with some darker, possibly rocky or coral-like structures to the right, all contributing to a muted underwater environment.",

  "explanation": "The seahorse exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its body features a mottled pattern of light beige, brown, and yellowish tones, which closely matches the sandy bottom and the subdued green and brown hues of the aquatic vegetation in its habitat. The irregular white speckles and darker spots on its body also help to disrupt its outline and mimic the varied textures and detritus found on the seabed, thereby reducing its contrast with the surroundings and making it harder for predators or prey to detect."
