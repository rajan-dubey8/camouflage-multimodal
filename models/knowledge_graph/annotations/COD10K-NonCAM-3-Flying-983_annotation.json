  "explanation": "The Regent Bowerbird exhibits striking bright yellow and glossy black plumage. These highly contrasting colors are not designed to blend with the green foliage and brown branches of its natural environment. Instead, this coloration is likely used for sexual display or warning, making the bird highly conspicuous rather than camouflaged. There is no mimicry, disruptive patterning, or color blending that would help it hide from predators or prey."
