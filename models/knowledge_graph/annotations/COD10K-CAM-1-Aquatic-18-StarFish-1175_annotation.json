  "object_name": "StarFish",
  "background_description": "The StarFish is positioned on a large, reddish-brown rock which has a rough, somewhat granular and sandy surface. There are lighter patches of sand and some areas with light green and white marine growth (possibly algae or sponges) on the rock. The surrounding underwater environment includes blurred greenish-brown elements in the background, likely other rocks and marine vegetation, and numerous small air bubbles are visible in the water.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The StarFish does not blend with its environment in this image. Its dark, mottled green-grey and blue coloration stands out significantly against the dominant reddish-brown and lighter sandy tones of the rock it is resting on. There is a high contrast in both color and luminance between the organism and its immediate background. Furthermore, the distinct five-pointed star shape of the StarFish is clearly recognizable and not disrupted by the irregular textures of the rock. While the StarFish has a bumpy texture, it does not specifically match the sandy, granular texture of the rock surface to provide effective camouflage."
