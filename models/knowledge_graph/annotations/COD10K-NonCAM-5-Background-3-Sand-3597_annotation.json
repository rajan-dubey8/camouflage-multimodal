  "background_description": "The image displays a close-up of sandy ground, characterized by a fine, granular texture in various shades of light brown and beige. Distinct patterns are formed by ripples or depressions in the sand, casting dark, elongated shadows that create strong visual contrast and emphasize the three-dimensional quality of the surface. The lighting appears to be natural sunlight, highlighting the individual grains and the undulating topography.",
