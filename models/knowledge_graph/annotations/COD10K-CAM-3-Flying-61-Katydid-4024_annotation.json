  "explanation": "The Katydid, while green, stands out significantly against the leaf it is resting on. Its body is a vibrant, almost neon green with distinctive bright yellow spots and a prominent pink/purple stripe along its back and on its head protrusion. The leaf itself is a much duller, darker green with brown tones and a rough, damaged texture. The Katydid's bright coloration creates a high color contrast, and its waxy, bumpy texture does not match the dry, veined texture of the leaf. Furthermore, the yellow eyes and pink/purple markings are striking against both the Katydid's own green and the background, preventing any effective blending. The overall effect is that the Katydid is highly visible."
