  "explanation": "The image features a dark-plumaged cormorant with noticeable blue eyes and orange facial skin, set against a brightly blurred green background. The bird's deep grey/black feathers and distinct silhouette create a high contrast with the much lighter and uniform green environment. There is no visual blending in terms of color or texture; the cormorant stands out prominently, indicating an absence of camouflage. Its dark color does not match the bright green, and its feathered texture is distinct from the smooth, out-of-focus background."
