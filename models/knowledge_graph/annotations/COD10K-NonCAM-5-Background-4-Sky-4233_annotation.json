The sky displays a dramatic split of colors, with clear blue on the left transitioning through purples and pinks to vibrant oranges and reds on the right, adorned with scattered clouds and a visible moon or bright star. The calm water below reflects these sky colors, showing ripples on its surface. Distant shorelines on both sides are visible, featuring an assortment of buildings including multi-story hotels and residential structures, as well as docks populated by numerous boats and yachts. A lone navigation marker stands in the middle of the water.",
