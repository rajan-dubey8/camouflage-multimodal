  "explanation": "The marmot exhibits strong camouflage through color blending. Its fur displays various shades of brown, tan, and dark brown/black, which highly match the blurred earthy and rocky colors of its natural background. This color palette allows the animal to blend seamlessly with its environment, reducing its visibility to predators. The subtle variations in fur color also provide a form of disruptive patterning that helps break up its outline against a mottled background, contributing to low contrast with the surroundings."
