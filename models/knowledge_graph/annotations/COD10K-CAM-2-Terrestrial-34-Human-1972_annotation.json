  "background_description": "The background consists of a vast expanse of calm, blue-green ocean water with gentle ripples on its surface, extending towards a hazy horizon where it meets a clear, bright blue sky that gradually lightens towards the horizon. A line of white and a few orange buoys are visible in the distance across the water.",

  "explanation": "The human is not camouflaged in this image. The visible part of the human (head and shoulders) has a distinct skin tone (warm, tanned) and dark hair which strongly contrasts with the cool blue-green colors of the surrounding ocean water. The smooth texture of the skin also differs significantly from the rippled surface of the water. The clear outline of the human's head creates a high contrast silhouette against the water and sky, making them easily identifiable and standing out rather than blending in."
