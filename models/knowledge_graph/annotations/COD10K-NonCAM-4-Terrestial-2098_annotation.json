  "explanation": "The otter, with its dark, sleek fur, is distinctly visible against the mixed green grass and brown earth/leaf litter background. Its coloration and form do not blend effectively with the immediate surroundings, making it easily detectable. While otters can exhibit camouflage in aquatic or muddy environments, in this specific terrestrial setting, there is no evidence of active camouflage; it stands out rather than blends in."
