  "object_name": "Sandy beach with footprints",
  "background_description": "The image displays a sandy beach with fine-grained, light beige sand. The sand shows subtle variations in texture and color due to light and shadows, creating a gently undulating surface. A trail of distinct footprints, likely from a bird or small animal, recedes into the distance. There are also a few small pieces of debris, such as a thin dark stick with a shadow, and a tiny white shell-like object.",
