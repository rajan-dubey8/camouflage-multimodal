  "background_description": "The image displays the rugged, deeply furrowed bark of a tree trunk, predominantly grey and dark brown, with reddish-brown fissures. Patches of vibrant, chartreuse-green arboreal lichen (likely a species of Usnea or similar fruticose lichen) are abundantly spread across the bark, creating a strong textural contrast. Some areas of the lichen and bark also show a dusting of white snow or ice. The background consists of blurred, tall tree trunks suggesting a forest setting.",
