  "explanation": "The Galapagos Tortoise exhibits camouflage through color blending. Its dark grey to dark brown shell and skin tones closely match the muted, earthy colors of the reddish-brown gravel path it is walking on. The rough, textured surface of its shell and skin also shares a moderate similarity with the granular texture of the ground, contributing to its ability to blend in. This natural coloration and texture minimize contrast and help the large reptile to appear less distinct from its immediate surroundings, particularly when viewed against the natural soil and rock formations of its habitat."
