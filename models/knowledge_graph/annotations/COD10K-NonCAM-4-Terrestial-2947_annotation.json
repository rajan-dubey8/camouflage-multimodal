  "explanation": "The Eastern Grey Squirrel's fur is primarily grey with brownish highlights on its head and back, which provides effective natural camouflage. This coloration allows it to blend seamlessly with the grey and brown tones of tree bark, branches, and the overall natural environment, making it less conspicuous to predators and prey. The muted greens and browns of the background further enhance this color blending."
