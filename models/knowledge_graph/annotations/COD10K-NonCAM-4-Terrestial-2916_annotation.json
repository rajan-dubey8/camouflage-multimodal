  "explanation": "The chipmunk exhibits effective camouflage primarily through its disruptive coloration. Its fur features alternating stripes of brown, reddish-brown, and off-white/black, which closely match the varied earthy tones and textures of the dirt, rocks, and scattered debris in its environment. The stripes help to break up the animal's overall silhouette, making it more difficult for predators to distinguish its form against the complex background. While its furry texture is distinct from the rough ground, the color blending and the disruptive pattern of its stripes significantly reduce its visibility, allowing it to blend into its natural habitat."
