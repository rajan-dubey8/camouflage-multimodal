  "explanation": "The egret's plumage is entirely bright white, which creates a high contrast against the dark, blurred green and brown natural background and the dark greyish-brown wooden structure. There is a significant difference in both color and luminosity between the bird and its surroundings, making it highly conspicuous rather than camouflaged. Its feathers also present a soft, feathery texture which is distinct from the blurry foliage and smooth wood, further reducing any similarity that might aid in blending."
