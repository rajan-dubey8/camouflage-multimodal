  "explanation": "The herons, with their distinct grey-blue plumage and solid forms, stand out against the background. While there are grey tones in the branches and blue in the sky, the herons' specific coloration does not closely match the predominant brown and dark grey of the bare branches. There is a high contrast between the birds' large, solid bodies and the intricate, open structure of the branches, especially where they are silhouetted against the bright blue sky. Their smooth feathered texture also contrasts significantly with the rough bark of the branches and the messy texture of the stick nests, making them easily discernible."
