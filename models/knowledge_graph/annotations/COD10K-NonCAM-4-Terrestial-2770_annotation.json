  "explanation": "The gray fur of the squirrel exhibits color blending with the natural environment. Its overall grey-brown coloration allows it to blend with the muted brown tones of the log and the earthy background, as well as the shadows cast by the surrounding vegetation. The white fur on its belly provides a form of countershading, making its body appear flatter and less three-dimensional by reducing the effect of natural shadows, which aids in overall concealment. While its fur texture is distinct from the wood, the color palette helps it to be less conspicuous in its habitat."
