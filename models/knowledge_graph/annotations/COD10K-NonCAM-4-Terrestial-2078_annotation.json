  "background_description": "The background consists of extensive dry savanna grasslands, characterized by tall, thin blades of grass in various shades of golden yellow, light brown, and amber. The lighting suggests late afternoon or early morning sunlight, casting a warm glow over the environment. The texture is natural and somewhat blurred, creating a soft, uniform field of dry vegetation.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The lion exhibits strong camouflage through color blending. Its tawny, sandy-brown fur closely matches the golden and light brown hues of the dry savanna grass in the background. The warm, golden hour lighting further enhances this blending by making the lion's coat appear almost identical in color to the illuminated grass. The low contrast between the lion's body and its surroundings makes it difficult to discern its outline, allowing it to merge effectively with its habitat for both hunting and concealment."
