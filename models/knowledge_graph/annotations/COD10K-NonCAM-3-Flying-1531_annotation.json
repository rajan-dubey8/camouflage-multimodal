  "explanation": "The House Sparrows exhibit a form of color blending camouflage. Their plumage, characterized by various shades of brown, gray, and off-white, helps them to moderately blend with the light gray concrete ledge and the muted, blurred greens and browns of the distant background. Although their distinct shapes and some darker patterns are visible, their natural cryptic coloration is designed to reduce overall contrast and integrate them into typical urban or natural environments, making them less conspicuous than a brightly colored bird would be. The color similarity is medium due to shared gray tones with the concrete and earthy tones with the background, while the feathery texture is distinct from the rough concrete, resulting in low texture similarity."
