  "object_name": "Dramatic cloudscape at sunset/sunrise",
  "background_description": "The image showcases a dynamic sky filled with large, billowing cumulus clouds. The upper and central clouds are illuminated by a warm, golden-orange light, suggesting either a sunset or sunrise. These bright clouds contrast sharply with darker, more ominous-looking grey and deep blue clouds that appear to be in shadow, especially towards the lower and right sections of the frame. Patches of deep blue, almost black, sky are visible between the cloud masses.",

  "explanation": "The image solely depicts an environmental scene of a cloud-filled sky. There are no visible organisms (animals, insects, or fish) present in the frame. Therefore, the concept of camouflage does not apply, and no camouflage is detected."
