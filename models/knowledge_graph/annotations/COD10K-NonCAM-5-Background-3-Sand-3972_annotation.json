  "explanation": "The image shows a group of people at the distant top of a sand dune. They are rendered as dark, high-contrast silhouettes against the lighter sky and dune surface, making them easily distinguishable. There is no visual attempt for them to blend into the sandy environment through color, pattern, or form. Their distinct shapes and lack of integration with the background textures confirm the absence of camouflage."
