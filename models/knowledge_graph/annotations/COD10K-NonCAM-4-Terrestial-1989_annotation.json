  "explanation": "The opossum is not camouflaged in this image. Its light grey and white fur, particularly the distinct white face, contrasts significantly with the very dark, out-of-focus background. There is low color and texture similarity between the animal and its immediate environment, making it stand out clearly rather than blending in. While opossums' coloring can offer some blending in specific natural nocturnal environments, in this specific photographic context, they are highly visible."
