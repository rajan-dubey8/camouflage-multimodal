  "explanation": "The coyote exhibits excellent camouflage through color blending. Its fur, a mix of gray, brown, and tan, closely matches the earthy tones of the sandy ground and dry vegetation in its natural habitat. This natural coloration helps the coyote to blend seamlessly into its environment, making it harder for prey and predators to detect, especially when it remains still."
