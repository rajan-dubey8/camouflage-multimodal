  "background_description": "The image displays a close-up of fine-grained sand, likely a tidal flat or beach, intricately sculpted into a series of parallel ripples or waves. Strong directional lighting casts distinct shadows, enhancing the three-dimensional texture and creating alternating bands of bright, light-brownish sand and dark, shadowed troughs. The overall color palette is earthy, dominated by various shades of brown and gray.",
