  "background_description": "The background consists of an underwater sandy seabed. The sand displays varying shades of yellow, light brown, and darker brownish-purple patches, indicating ripples, depressions, and possibly areas of finer sediment or organic matter. The water above gives a slightly hazy, purplish tint to the upper part of the image, and light penetrates from above, creating shadows and highlights on the sandy floor.",

  "explanation": "Multiple flounders are visible in the image, demonstrating excellent camouflage. Their flat bodies are colored with mottled patterns of light brown and grey, which highly match the surrounding sandy seabed in both hue and tone. The texture of their skin also blends well with the granular appearance of the sand. For instance, the flounder in the bottom left is almost entirely indistinguishable from the sand, partially buried with its shape disrupted by the surrounding sediment. The flounder in the top right also blends seamlessly. The most prominent flounder in the center, while casting a noticeable shadow due to the lighting conditions, still exhibits strong color and pattern matching with the sand. Its flat shape also helps it to lie flush with the bottom, disrupting its outline against the seabed contours. The primary factor reducing perfect camouflage for the central individual is its distinct shadow, which increases the overall contrast difference. However, the species' inherent ability to blend through color, pattern, and shape is clearly evident and highly effective."
