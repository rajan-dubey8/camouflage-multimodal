  "explanation": "The zebras, with their distinct black and white stripes, stand out prominently against the light brown, sandy ground and dark rocks. There is minimal color or texture similarity between the zebras and their immediate environment. The high contrast of their stripes makes them easily discernible, indicating a lack of effective visual camouflage in this specific bright, open setting. While zebra stripes may serve other biological functions like disruptive coloration in herds or against biting flies, they do not provide concealment here."
