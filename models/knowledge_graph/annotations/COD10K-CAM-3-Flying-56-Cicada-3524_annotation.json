  "background_description": "The background consists of several vibrant green leaves, likely from a single plant. The leaves have a distinctly textured, bumpy surface with visible veins and numerous small, white, possibly hairy or reflective spots. The edges of the leaves and some veins are adorned with fine, reddish-tinged hairs. There are also darker, out-of-focus areas suggesting deeper foliage or shadows.",

  "explanation": "The Cicada exhibits strong camouflage primarily through color blending. Its main body and wings are a bright, vivid green that closely matches the dominant hue of the host leaf. This excellent color similarity makes the insect blend seamlessly with its immediate surroundings, making it difficult to detect at first glance. While the texture of the cicada is relatively smooth compared to the bumpy and hairy surface of the leaf, and the small orange/yellow tips on its wings introduce a slight color contrast, the overall effect of the widespread green coloration significantly reduces its visibility. The contrast difference is low due to the overwhelming green matching."
