  "explanation": "The roe deer exhibits good camouflage primarily through color blending. Its fawn-colored, brownish-tan coat closely matches the earthy tones and the dried, yellowish-brown vegetation present in the dense forest undergrowth. While the green foliage provides a contrast, the deer's natural coloration helps it merge with the less vibrant parts of the background, especially in dappled light or shadow. The dense plants also partially obscure its body, further aiding its concealment by breaking up its outline, although its head is quite visible. The overall effect allows the deer to be less conspicuous in its natural habitat."
