  "background_description": "The image features a vast sky with prominent clouds and sun rays. The upper part is a clear, deep blue, transitioning to lighter blues. A large mass of dark, shadowed cumulus clouds occupies the middle and lower sections. The sun is positioned behind these clouds on the right side, casting brilliant crepuscular rays that pierce through the openings, illuminating the edges of some clouds with bright white and golden light. A faint outline of urban structures or buildings is visible along the very bottom horizon.",
