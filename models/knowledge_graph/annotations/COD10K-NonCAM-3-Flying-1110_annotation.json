  "explanation": "The Spotted Dove's plumage, characterized by shades of gray and brown on the head and neck, and a distinctive black and white spotted pattern on the lower neck and chest, does not blend with the plain, bright green, out-of-focus background. There is a strong color and pattern contrast between the bird and its surroundings, making it highly visible rather than camouflaged in this specific environmental context."
