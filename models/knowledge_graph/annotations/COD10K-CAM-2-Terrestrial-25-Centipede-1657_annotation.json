  "object_name": "Centipede",
  "background_description": "The centipede is situated on a piece of light to medium brown wood, possibly a decaying log or branch. The surface is highly textured with visible wood grain, numerous splinters, and fibrous fragments. Scattered across the wood are small, dark specks, likely dirt or fungal growth. The background beyond the wood is out of focus, showing blurred green foliage and lighter, indistinct shapes.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.75,

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The centipede exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its body coloration, which includes various shades of reddish-browns and darker segments, closely matches the dominant colors of the textured wood surface it rests upon, as well as the dark specks of dirt. This high color similarity significantly reduces its visibility. The contrast difference between the centipede and its environment is low, meaning it does not stand out sharply against the background. While the centipede's segmented and somewhat glossy texture is not identical to the rough, fibrous wood, the overall irregular nature of both the organism and its surroundings, including the splinters and dirt, helps to disrupt its outline and contribute to the blending effect. The combination of matching colors and low contrast makes it reasonably difficult to spot."
