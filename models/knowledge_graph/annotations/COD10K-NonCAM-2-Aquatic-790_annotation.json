  "explanation": "The fish exhibits a clear disruptive camouflage pattern with bold, dark vertical stripes against a lighter, yellowish-brown body. This pattern helps to break up its perceived outline and shape, making it difficult for predators or prey to distinguish the fish as a single entity within the visually cluttered, murky green and brown aquatic environment. The high contrast of the stripes on its body effectively creates false edges, while the overall coloration provides a medium similarity to the background tones."
