  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits camouflage through color blending. Its grey and brownish fur closely matches the earthy, natural tones present in the background, specifically blending well with the tree bark, soil, and shadowy areas typical of its habitat. While the foreground has some lighter seeds, the overall coloration of the squirrel helps it to merge with the muted, natural environment, reducing its visibility. The texture of its fur also provides a medium similarity to the somewhat rough and granular background elements."
