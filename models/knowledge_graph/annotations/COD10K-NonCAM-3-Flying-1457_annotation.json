  "object_category": "Insect",
  "object_name": "Insect on a flower",
  "background_description": "The insect is perched on a cluster of small white flowers with delicate stamens. The immediate background behind the flower cluster is a soft, out-of-focus green, suggesting foliage or grass.",

  "contrast_difference": "high",
  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The insect's body, which is predominantly mottled dark grey, brown, and black with reddish-orange legs, creates a high contrast against the bright white flowers it is resting on. While the insect's general coloration might offer some blending in a different environment like bark or soil, in this specific context of white flowers and a green background, it is distinctly visible and does not exhibit any form of camouflage."
