  "explanation": "The butterfly's bright orange wings with distinct black spots, along with some blue accents, create a strong contrast against the predominantly green leaves. While its colors somewhat match the yellow/orange flowers, the overall impression is one of high visibility against the dominant green background. This coloration is characteristic of aposematism (warning coloration) rather than camouflage, as the butterfly is designed to be easily seen by predators, potentially signaling toxicity or unpalatability, thus it is not camouflaged."
