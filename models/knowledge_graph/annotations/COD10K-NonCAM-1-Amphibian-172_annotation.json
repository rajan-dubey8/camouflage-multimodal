  "object_name": "Toad",
  "background_description": "Although the immediate surroundings are a concrete surface and a brick wall, typical aquatic environments for a toad include the muddy banks of a shallow freshwater pond, slow-moving stream edges, or damp riparian zones with leaf litter and small stones, which are often characterized by earthy tones and natural debris.",

  "explanation": "A visible toad is clearly resting on a terrestrial concrete surface next to a brick wall. The animal's mottled brown and beige coloration, along with its bumpy texture, offers some natural blending with the earthy tones and rough textures of the immediate visible background. However, the toad is distinctly identifiable and stands out sufficiently, confirming that no camouflage is present."
