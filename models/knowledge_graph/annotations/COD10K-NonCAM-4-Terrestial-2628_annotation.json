  "explanation": "The two Takins display a form of camouflage through color blending. Their thick fur coats are primarily light brown, beige, and golden-tan, with darker grey-brown on their legs and manes. These colors closely match the various shades of grey and earthy tones present in the rocky background. While their fur texture is distinct from the hard rock, the overall coloration allows them to blend in with their natural, mountainous, and rocky habitat, reducing their visibility to predators or prey. The contrast between the animals and the background is moderate, further aiding in their visual integration with the environment."
