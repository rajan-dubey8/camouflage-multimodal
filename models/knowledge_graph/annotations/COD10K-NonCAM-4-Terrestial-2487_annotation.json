  "explanation": "The Dik-Dik exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-brown and tan fur closely matches the dry, muted colors of the background vegetation, primarily dry grasses and earth. The animal's overall tone and lightness have low contrast with its surroundings, making it difficult to discern its outline. This allows it to blend seamlessly into its natural habitat, providing protection from predators."
