  "explanation": "The image depicts a sailboat on the open ocean. Camouflage is a biological adaptation used by organisms to blend with their surroundings. Since a sailboat is a man-made object and not an organism, the concept of biological camouflage does not apply. The boat's light-colored hull and dark mast are distinctly visible against the dark blue water, indicating it is not designed to blend in."
