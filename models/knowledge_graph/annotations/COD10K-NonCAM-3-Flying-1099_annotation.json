  "object_name": "White-banded Blue Crow butterfly",
  "background_description": "The background consists of natural ground cover, primarily dark green foliage with small broad leaves and slender grass blades, mixed with various shades of brown dried leaves, twigs, and exposed dark soil.",

  "texture_similarity": "none",
  "contrast_difference": "high",
  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The butterfly's wings feature a striking pattern of prominent black and contrasting pale blue-white translucent patches. This coloration stands out significantly against the natural green and brown hues of the background foliage and soil. There is no visual resemblance in color, pattern, or texture to the surrounding environment, indicating an absence of camouflage. The butterfly's conspicuous appearance suggests it may rely on other defense mechanisms, such as warning coloration (aposematism), rather than concealment."
