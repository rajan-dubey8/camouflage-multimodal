  "background_description": "The scene depicts a sunrise or sunset over a calm ocean from a beach perspective. The sky transitions from a soft, pale blue-grey at the top to warmer hues of orange and yellow near the horizon, where the sun is partially obscured by faint clouds, casting a diffused glow. Dark, silhouetted palm fronds frame the top corners of the image. The ocean surface is relatively calm, reflecting the sun's light in a subtle streak. The foreground consists of a sandy beach with several dark, irregular rocks breaking the water's edge.",
