  "background_description": "The image features a large, weathered sandstone rock formation dominating the foreground, set against a clear, deep blue sky. The rock exhibits a light tan to yellowish-brown color, with varying shades due to sunlight and shadow. Its surface is characterized by a rough, craggy texture, deep horizontal fissures, and numerous irregular holes and indentations, indicating significant erosion. The upper parts of the formation appear rounded and smoothed in places, contrasting with sharper breaks in others. Shadows cast across its surface highlight the intricate geological patterns and relief.",
