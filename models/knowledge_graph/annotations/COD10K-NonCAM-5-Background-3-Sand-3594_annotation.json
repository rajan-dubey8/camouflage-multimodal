  "background_description": "The image showcases a vast desert landscape characterized by pristine white sand dunes. The sand surface exhibits distinct, wave-like ripple patterns formed by wind, indicating a fine, granular texture. The dunes gradually rise and recede towards the horizon, creating gentle undulations. Above the bright sand, the sky is a striking deep, dark blue, providing a sharp color contrast with the stark white ground.",
