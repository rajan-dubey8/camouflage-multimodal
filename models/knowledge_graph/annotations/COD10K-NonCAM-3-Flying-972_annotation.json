  "explanation": "The Paper Kite butterfly exhibits stark black and white patterns on its wings, which create a high contrast against the predominantly green leafy background and even against the white flower it is resting on. This distinct coloration makes the butterfly highly conspicuous, rather than blending in with its surroundings. Therefore, it is not exhibiting camouflage in this environment; its patterns are likely a form of aposematism or mimicry rather than crypsis."
