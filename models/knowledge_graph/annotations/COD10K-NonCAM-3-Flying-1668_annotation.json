  "explanation": "The Canada goose and the numerous pigeons are clearly visible in the image and do not exhibit any form of camouflage. The goose's distinct white chin strap, dark neck and head, and patterned brown body feathers create a strong contrast against the green grass, water, and surrounding vegetation, making it easily discernible. Similarly, the pigeons, with their typical grey and iridescent plumage, stand out against the green ground and are not blending with any specific textures or colors for concealment. While their natural coloration is suitable for their environment, it does not provide active concealment or mimicry, resulting in high contrast and easy detection."
