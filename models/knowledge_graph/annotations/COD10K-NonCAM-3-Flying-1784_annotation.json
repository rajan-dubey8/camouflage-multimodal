  "explanation": "The Black-crowned Night Heron is prominently displayed in sharp focus, contrasting strongly with the extremely blurred background. Its light greyish-white plumage, dark head, and striking red eyes do not blend with the purple, white, and green tones of the environment. The sharp definition of the bird against the soft, indistinct background further enhances its visibility, indicating a complete lack of camouflage in this specific setting."
