  "explanation": "A small reef fish, likely a butterflyfish, is visible in the left-center of the image. Its bright yellow and white coloration provides a high contrast against the surrounding coral reef, which is predominantly composed of muted browns, greens, and beige corals. The fish's distinct shape and coloration make it easily distinguishable from the background, indicating no attempt at camouflage."
