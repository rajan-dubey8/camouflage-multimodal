  "explanation": "The Chamois exhibit color blending camouflage. Their dark greyish-brown fur provides a medium color match with the earthy and dried grass tones of their rocky and grassy mountain habitat. The texture of their fur, while distinct, generally aligns with the rough appearance of the natural environment. While they are not perfectly invisible, their coloration helps them blend into the shadows and the overall muted palette of their environment, reducing their visibility against the varied terrain."
