  "background_description": "The image captures a vibrant coastal scene under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds. In the foreground, tranquil turquoise-blue ocean waters transition to a pristine white sandy beach. Moving inland, the landscape consists of a dry, low-lying plain with sparse light green vegetation and scattered darker green bushes. A prominent lighthouse with a white tower and a reddish-pink base and roof stands on this plain.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "No organisms (animals, insects, or fish) are visible anywhere in the image. The image depicts a natural coastal environment with a man-made structure (lighthouse). Therefore, there is no entity present to exhibit camouflage, and the concepts of color/texture similarity and contrast for camouflage detection are not applicable."
