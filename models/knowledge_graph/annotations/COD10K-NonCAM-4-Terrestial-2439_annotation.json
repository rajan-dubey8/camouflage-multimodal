  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The deer's grayish-brown fur color closely matches the dry, woody vegetation and sparse ground cover in the background. This excellent color blending allows the deer to seamlessly integrate with its natural habitat, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding branches and dried foliage. The muted tones of its coat mimic the overall color palette of the environment, significantly reducing its visibility to predators or observers."
