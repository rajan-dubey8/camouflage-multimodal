  "explanation": "The Anhinga chicks are predominantly white and light gray, which creates a high contrast against the dark brown, gnarled branches and twigs of their nest. Their soft, downy texture also differs significantly from the rough texture of the branches. While their pale color might blend slightly with a very bright sky under certain lighting, their immediate surroundings (the nest and tree) do not offer effective camouflage. The chicks are quite conspicuous in this environment."
