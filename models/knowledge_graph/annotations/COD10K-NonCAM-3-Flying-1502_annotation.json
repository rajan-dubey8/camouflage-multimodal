  "explanation": "The Northern Mockingbird exhibits camouflage through color blending. Its muted grey and off-white plumage helps it to blend with the soft, desaturated tones of the background sky and the somewhat faded, dry foliage it is perched within. While its outline is discernible against some of the darker parts of the bush, its overall coloration matches the ambient light conditions and the general color palette of its immediate surroundings, reducing its conspicuity rather than making it completely invisible."
