  "explanation": "The 'Bees' (which visually resemble wasps) exhibit bright yellow and dark reddish-brown striped patterns on their bodies. This distinct coloration creates a strong contrast against the surrounding green leaf and the brown papery nest they are situated within. Their vivid markings make them highly visible, indicating a lack of camouflage. Such coloration is typically aposematic, serving as a warning to predators rather than for blending into the environment. Consequently, there is low color and texture similarity with the immediate background, resulting in a high contrast difference."
