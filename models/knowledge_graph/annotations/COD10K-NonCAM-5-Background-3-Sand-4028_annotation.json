  "background_description": "The image features a serene tropical beach landscape. The upper portion shows a vibrant clear blue sky with a few wispy white clouds. Below the sky, the horizon line marks the vast ocean, which displays a gradient of colors from deep blue at the furthest point to a lighter, greenish-turquoise nearer the shore. The foreground is dominated by wet, light golden-brown sand, textured by the receding water lines from waves, creating a soft, streaky appearance, typical of a long-exposure photograph.",
