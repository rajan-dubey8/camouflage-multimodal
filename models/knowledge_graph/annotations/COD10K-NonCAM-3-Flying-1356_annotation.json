  "camouflage_type": "Disruptive pattern",
  "explanation": "The bird exhibits camouflage primarily through disruptive patterning and color blending. Its streaked brown and off-white plumage creates a broken outline that helps it blend with the dappled light and shadows filtering through the tree canopy. The vertical streaks on its chest and belly mimic the linear elements of branches or gaps in foliage, making it harder for predators or prey to distinguish its form. The brown coloration of its back and wings also provides color matching with the tree branch and other woody elements of its environment."
