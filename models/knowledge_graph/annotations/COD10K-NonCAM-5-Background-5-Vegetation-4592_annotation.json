  "object_name": "Mossy temperate forest with boardwalk",
  "background_description": "The image displays a dense, verdant temperate forest. The scene is dominated by tall, slender trees with rich green foliage and branches often draped in moss. The forest floor, including exposed tree roots and fallen logs, is heavily carpeted with thick, bright green moss, suggesting a damp environment. A wooden boardwalk, composed of light brown planks, winds through the forest, providing a clear path. Dappled sunlight filters through the canopy, creating varied lighting conditions across the scene. The overall color palette is a harmonious blend of greens, earthy browns, and some grey tones.",
