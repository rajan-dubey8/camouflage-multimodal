  "background_description": "The scene features a body of water, likely a lake or pond, reflecting a bright blue sky with white clouds. Dark green tree foliage overhangs the water from the top and left, casting shadows. The water's surface is partially covered with patches of dark aquatic vegetation. On the left side, a path made of light-colored, irregular stone slabs and dirt runs along the water's edge, with some small green plants growing. A tree with light-colored bark emerges from the ground near the path and bends over the water. In the distant background, a small, light-colored structure (possibly a gazebo) with a prominent roof is visible across the water.",
