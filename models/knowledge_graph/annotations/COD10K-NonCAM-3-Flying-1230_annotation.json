  "explanation": "The image features an ostrich with a predominantly dark-feathered body, a long grey neck, and grey legs, standing against a bright green and yellow grassy background. The ostrich's dark coloration, distinct silhouette, and lack of patterns that mimic the grass lead to a high contrast difference with its surroundings. Therefore, no camouflage is present; the ostrich is clearly visible and stands out against the environment."
