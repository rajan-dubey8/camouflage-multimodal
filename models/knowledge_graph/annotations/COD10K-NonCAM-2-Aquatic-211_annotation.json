  "explanation": "The image clearly displays three distinct fish: a large, bright yellow Goldfish with flowing fins in the foreground, a smaller white Goldfish behind it, and a large, dark-colored Pangasius Catfish in the upper left background. Their vibrant colors and clear outlines contrast sharply with the artificial plants, rocks, and substrate, ensuring they are easily discernible and not camouflaged."
