  "object_category": "Amphibian",
  "object_name": "Green tree frog",
  "background_description": "The frog is resting on a white, slightly textured surface, likely a window sill or frame. The background behind the frog is dark and out of focus, appearing as a blurred black void, with what seems to be a pane of glass showing some faint reflections or dust to the right of the frog.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The frog's vibrant green coloration, while inherently a form of color blending camouflage in its natural habitat of green foliage, stands out significantly against the stark white window sill and the dark, blurred background in this image. There is no visual resemblance in color or texture between the frog and its immediate surroundings, making it highly conspicuous rather than camouflaged."
