  "background_description": "The image captures a wide-angle view of a rugged coastal landscape. The foreground features a sandy beach transitioning into a rocky shore, leading up to a gently sloping hill covered in dry, reddish-brown and golden-yellow moorland vegetation. Several white-walled buildings with dark roofs are situated on the hillside, surrounded by fencing. The middle ground is dominated by a vast expanse of deep blue sea, with a tiny yellow object visible in the water. In the far distance, a chain of dark, rocky islands or mountains stretches across the horizon under a pale blue, slightly overcast sky.",
