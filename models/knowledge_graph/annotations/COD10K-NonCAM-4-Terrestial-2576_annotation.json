  "explanation": "The giraffe exhibits camouflage through its distinctive disruptive pattern of dark brown spots against a lighter tan/cream background. This pattern helps to break up the animal's silhouette, making it harder for predators to distinguish its outline against the complex backdrop of dappled light and shadow found in its natural savannah habitat. While the immediate background in this image is blurred and not its natural environment, the inherent coloration and patterning are a form of camouflage designed to blend with trees, dry grasses, and varying light conditions. The high contrast between the spots and the lighter fur contributes to this disruptive effect."
