  "explanation": "The lizard exhibits excellent camouflage by blending seamlessly with the rock environment. Its dark, mottled grey-brown coloration closely matches the dominant tones and patterns of the rock. The rough, textured scales of the lizard mimic the grainy and uneven surface of the rock. Furthermore, the lizard is positioned along a natural crevice, utilizing the existing shadow and irregular contours of the rock to further break up its outline and conceal its presence, making it very difficult to spot at first glance."
