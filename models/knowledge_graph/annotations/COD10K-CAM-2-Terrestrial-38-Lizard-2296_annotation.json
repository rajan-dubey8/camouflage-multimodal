  "background_description": "The background consists of a dense scattering of dry, light to medium brown wood chips, twigs, and fallen leaves. There are varying textures, from smooth branch segments to rough, shredded wood and crinkled leaves. Sparse patches of thin green grass are also visible. The environment is cluttered and heterogeneous, with numerous linear and angular elements created by the debris. Sunlight casts distinct highlights and shadows across the ground cover.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Pattern matching",
  "explanation": "The lizard exhibits effective camouflage through a combination of color blending and pattern matching. Its body coloration, which is primarily brownish-tan with prominent lighter stripes, closely matches the dominant hues of the dry wood chips, twigs, and leaves that make up its environment. The linear stripes on its back also serve to disrupt its outline and blend with the numerous linear and angular textures of the surrounding debris, making it difficult to distinguish from the background clutter. The overall contrast between the lizard and its environment is low, allowing it to integrate well into the heterogeneous visual field."
