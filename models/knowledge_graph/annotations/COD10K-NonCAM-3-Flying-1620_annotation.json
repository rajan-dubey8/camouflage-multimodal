  "explanation": "The seagull's distinct white and grey plumage, bright yellow beak, and orange feet stand out prominently against the varied background of light grey stone, green grass, and deep blue sea. Its colors and textures do not blend with any element of its immediate surroundings, making it highly conspicuous. There is no attempt at color matching, disruptive patterning, or mimicry that would suggest camouflage."
