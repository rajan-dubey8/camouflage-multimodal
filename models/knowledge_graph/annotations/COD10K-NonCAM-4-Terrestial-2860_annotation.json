  "explanation": "The two Southern Lapwings are clearly visible against the bright green grass. Their distinct plumage featuring a black chest, white belly, grey head, and brownish-grey wings creates a strong contrast with the uniform green background. There is a significant mismatch in both color and texture between the birds and their surroundings, indicating no effective camouflage in this environment."
