  "explanation": "The Eastern Gray Squirrel in the image demonstrates effective camouflage through color blending. Its grey-brown fur, particularly on its back and sides, closely matches the natural earthy tones of the soil, dried leaves, and tree bark commonly found in its habitat. The bushy tail, with its blend of brown and grey tones and fluffy texture, further aids in breaking up its silhouette and blending seamlessly with the textured ground cover and distant foliage. The overall low contrast between the squirrel and its immediate environment, combined with high color and texture similarity, reduces its visibility to predators and prey, making it less conspicuous."
