  "explanation": "The lizard demonstrates excellent camouflage against the rocky environment. Its body coloration, featuring a base of light tan/grey and distinct wavy, dark brown bands, closely matches the various hues and patterns present on the rock surface. The light areas on its body blend with the lighter, sandy-colored patches of the rock, while the dark bands align with the darker crevices and shadows, effectively breaking up the lizard's outline. This combination of color blending and pattern matching makes the lizard highly inconspicuous and difficult to spot at first glance, indicating strong camouflage."
