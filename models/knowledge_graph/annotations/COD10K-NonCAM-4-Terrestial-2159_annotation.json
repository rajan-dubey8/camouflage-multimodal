  "explanation": "The howler monkey's fur is a reddish-brown color, which is naturally adapted for 'color blending' within its typical forest habitat, matching tree trunks, branches, and shaded areas. However, in this specific image, the monkey is presented against a bright, out-of-focus background of vibrant green leaves and what appears to be a bright sky. This creates a high contrast between its dark fur and the bright background, resulting in low color and texture similarity with its immediate surroundings. Therefore, despite its inherent camouflage adaptation, its effectiveness is low in this particular visual context, making it relatively visible."
