  "explanation": "The beetle exhibits a striking black and bright yellow coloration on its body and the tips of its antennae, which creates a very high contrast against the plain, light-colored background. This bold and easily noticeable pattern is characteristic of aposematic (warning) coloration, designed to advertise the organism's presence and potential toxicity or unpalatability to predators, rather than to conceal it. The colors and textures of the beetle do not blend with the surrounding environment."
