  "background_description": "The scene depicts a wide open industrial or construction yard. The ground is predominantly covered in reddish-brown gravel and dirt, with some darker patches and visible tire tracks. In the mid-ground and background, there are various man-made structures including stacks of timber or pipes, dark metal containers (possibly dumpsters or storage units), and several buildings, some appearing residential and others more industrial. Bare trees are visible towards the horizon. The sky is very dramatic, filled with textured, thick purplish-grey clouds, exhibiting lighter pinkish-purple hues in places.",
