  "object_category": "Mammal",
  "object_name": "Cat",
  "background_description": "The organism is nestled under a large, rumpled, tan-colored comforter or duvet. This creates a dark, shadowy recess. Below the comforter, a white sheet or comforter with a repeating floral pattern of pink roses and green/blue leaves is visible. In the upper left background, piles of various colored clothes (red, blue, black, grey) are visible on what appears to be another part of the bed.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "While the cat is partially obscured by the shadow created by the comforter, its visible face, particularly its bright, alert eyes and lighter muzzle, stands out clearly against the dark recess. The cat's tabby fur pattern and colors do not match the solid tan of the comforter or the distinct floral pattern of the bed sheet below it. There is a high contrast between the cat's features and its immediate surroundings, making it easily detectable rather than blended."
