  "background_description": "The scene portrays a breathtaking sunset over a vast body of water, likely an ocean or large sea. The sky exhibits a dramatic gradient, transitioning from a deep, dark indigo at the top, through purples and mauves in the middle, to brilliant shades of orange and yellow near the horizon, indicative of the sun setting. Wispy, elongated clouds are scattered across the mid-sky, appearing as dark silhouettes against the bright sunset hues. Distinct crepuscular rays are visible, fanning out from the sun's position. The water surface below is relatively calm, reflecting the warm, deep orange and brown tones of the sky, with subtle ripples and texture visible across its expanse. A faint silhouette of land or a small island can be seen on the horizon.",
