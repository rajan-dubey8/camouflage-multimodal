  "explanation": "The butterfly displays vibrant orange wings with distinct black and white markings. This coloration strongly contrasts with the grey, granular texture of the concrete background. There is no attempt at blending in via color, pattern, or texture with its immediate environment. The bright colors likely serve as a warning (aposematism) rather than for concealment."
