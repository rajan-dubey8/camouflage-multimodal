  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its grayish-brown fur closely matches the color tones of the gray concrete pavers it is perched on, as well as the reddish-brown stone blocks nearby. The coarse, varied texture of its fur also aligns well with the rough, granular surfaces of the stone and concrete, enhancing its ability to merge with the environment. The low contrast difference between the squirrel's body and its immediate surroundings further aids in reducing its visibility, making it less conspicuous to predators or observers in this mixed urban-natural setting."
