  "explanation": "The sparrow's brown, tan, and grey plumage, while inherently suitable for blending into some natural environments (like dry grass or tree bark), contrasts highly with the very bright, light blue to white, out-of-focus sky that forms the majority of the background. Although it is perched on a branch with some muted yellowish-green foliage, the bird's form and coloration stand out clearly against this particular bright and soft background, offering no effective camouflage."
