  "explanation": "The domestic cat has prominent white fur, dark tabby stripes, and some brown patches. The background is a dark, rough concrete or asphalt surface. The white fur of the cat provides a high contrast against the dark background, making the animal easily discernible. While some of the darker tabby markings might share very minor color tones with parts of the ground, the overall pattern and color distribution of the cat do not aim to blend in or obscure its outline against this particular environment. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
