The horizon is marked by two distinct landmasses: a rocky, arid-looking hill with sparse vegetation on the left, and a long strip of green trees on the right. Above, a dramatic sky is filled with heavy, dark grey storm clouds, predominantly on the left and upper right. A long, bright white, elongated cloud, illuminated by sunlight, stretches across the middle of the sky, contrasting with the darker clouds.",
