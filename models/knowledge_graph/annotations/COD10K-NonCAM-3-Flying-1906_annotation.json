  "explanation": "The Chaffinch bird in this image is not camouflaged. Its distinct plumage, featuring a blue-grey head, reddish-orange breast, and prominent black and white wing markings, creates a high contrast against the uniformly light beige and grey granular ground. Neither its colors nor its smooth feathered texture blend with the rough, pale environment, making the bird easily visible."
