  "background_description": "The background consists of a rocky, grassy alpine or subalpine environment under an overcast sky. Numerous rocks of various sizes and shapes, predominantly in shades of grey, brown, and reddish-brown, are scattered across the terrain. Many rocks have patches of lichen, adding green and dark textures. Sparse clumps of dry, yellowish-green grass grow between the rocks. The distant sky is a muted, pale blue-grey, suggesting a hazy or cloudy condition.",

  "explanation": "The marmot exhibits strong camouflage through color blending with its environment. Its fur, a grizzled mix of dark grey and brown, closely matches the dominant colors of the rocks and patches of soil in the background. The varied texture of its fur also blends well with the rough surfaces of the rocks and the clumps of dry grass. The overall low contrast between the marmot and its surroundings, combined with the natural patterns and textures, makes it difficult to distinguish from the rocky, vegetated ground, effectively concealing it in its natural habitat."
