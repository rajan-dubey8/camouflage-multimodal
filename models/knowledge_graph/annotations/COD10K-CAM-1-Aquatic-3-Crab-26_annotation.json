  "background_description": "The background consists of numerous rounded to oval-shaped pebbles and rocks, predominantly in shades of reddish-brown and earthy terracotta. The surfaces of these rocks appear somewhat rough and granular, possibly covered with fine sand or sediment, and they vary slightly in size and depth, creating natural shadows and highlights.",

  "explanation": "The crab demonstrates excellent camouflage in this image. Its carapace and legs are heavily covered in fine sand or sediment, which perfectly matches the reddish-brown color and granular texture of the surrounding pebbles and rocks. This active accumulation of debris on its shell acts as both color blending and texture matching. The overall coloration of the crab is nearly identical to the background, and the sandy texture of its shell further enhances this resemblance, making it very difficult to distinguish its outline from the irregular surfaces of the rocks. The low contrast difference between the crab and its environment contributes significantly to its successful concealment."
