  "explanation": "The Galapagos Tortoise is prominently visible against the green grassy background. Its dark, leathery skin and large, dark gray-brown shell create a high contrast with the brighter green and finer textures of the surrounding vegetation. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning that would help it conceal itself in this environment. Its large size and distinct form make it easily discernible."
