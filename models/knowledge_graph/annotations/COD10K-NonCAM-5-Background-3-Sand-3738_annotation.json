  "background_description": "A vast, exposed tidal flat at low tide, characterized by dark brown, wet mud interspersed with small pebbles and rocks. Patches of green algae or seaweed are visible in the foreground. In the mid-ground, a small, weathered blue and white fishing boat rests on the mud. The background features a calm body of water, possibly the distant sea or the returning tide, beneath a cloudy, pale grey sky with faint distant hills on the horizon.",
