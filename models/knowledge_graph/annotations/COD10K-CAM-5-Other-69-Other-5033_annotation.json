  "explanation": "The image features an African elephant largely obscured by dense green and brown vegetation. While the bush provides physical cover and concealment for the elephant, the animal itself does not exhibit intrinsic camouflage properties (such as color blending, disruptive patterns, or mimicry) that allow it to blend with the foliage. Its dark grey, wrinkled skin is distinctly different in color and texture from the surrounding green leaves and brown branches. The elephant is hidden *by* its environment rather than being camouflaged *as part of* it."
