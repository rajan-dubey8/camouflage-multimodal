  "background_description": "The image depicts a vibrant, lush mountainous landscape under daylight. The foreground features dense green foliage, including tree trunks with brown bark on the left and various leafy plants and bushes with shades of bright to deep green. A broad valley in the midground reveals flatter, possibly cultivated areas (rice paddies or tea plantations) in lighter shades of green, with some water bodies visible. In the background, rolling hills and mountains are covered in dense tropical or subtropical forest, appearing in progressively lighter and hazier shades of green and blue towards the horizon. The overall scene is dominated by a rich palette of greens with natural textures from tree leaves, bark, and distant mountain contours.",
