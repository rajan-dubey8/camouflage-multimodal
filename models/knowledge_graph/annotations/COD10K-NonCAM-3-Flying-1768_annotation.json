  "explanation": "The bumblebee's distinct black, yellow, and white banding creates a high contrast with the light purple flower it is perched upon. Its fuzzy texture also differs significantly from the spiky petals of the flower. This coloration is aposematic (warning coloration) rather than cryptic, signaling to potential predators that the bee may be dangerous (e.g., capable of stinging), and therefore does not serve to camouflage it within this environment."
