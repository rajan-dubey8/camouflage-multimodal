Its canopy consists of dense, leathery leaves, predominantly a silvery-green hue, with some scattered leaves showing a reddish-orange coloration, suggesting seasonal change. The background behind the tree is composed of blurry green foliage, indicating a forest or dense shrubland. The ground beneath the tree is covered with a layer of dry, reddish-brown fallen leaves and sparse green undergrowth. A dark paved path or dirt trail is visible on the left side of the frame. The lighting is bright and somewhat diffuse, with a bright sky visible at the top.",
