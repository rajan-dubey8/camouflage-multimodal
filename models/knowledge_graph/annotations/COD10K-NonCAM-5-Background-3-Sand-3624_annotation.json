  "background_description": "The scene is dominated by a vast desert landscape featuring numerous undulating sand dunes. The dunes exhibit a range of colors from light sandy beige and golden hues to deeper reddish-ochre tones, particularly in the foreground and some shadowed slopes. The textures appear smooth and fine-grained, characteristic of wind-sculpted sand. The sky above is clear and light blue, contrasting with the warm tones of the desert.",
