  "background_description": "The image displays a close-up of fine-grained sand forming distinct parallel ripples or ridges, likely sculpted by wind or water. The sand exhibits warm tones, with bright golden-orange areas on the crests of the ripples, illuminated by a low-angle light source (suggesting sunrise or sunset), and deep, dark brown shadows in the troughs. This creates a strong, repetitive striped pattern with a granular texture.",
