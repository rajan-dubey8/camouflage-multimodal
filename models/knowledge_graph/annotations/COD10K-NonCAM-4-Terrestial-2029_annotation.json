  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits camouflage through color blending. Its grey and brownish fur tones closely match the grey-brown and greenish hues of the tree bark, allowing it to blend into its arboreal environment. While its form is still discernible, the natural coloration helps to reduce its visibility against the textured trunk, aiding in concealment from predators or prey. The texture of its fur, while different from bark, provides a varied surface that helps break up its outline against the complex texture of the tree."
