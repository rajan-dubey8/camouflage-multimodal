  "explanation": "The grasshopper exhibits effective camouflage against its environment. Its body and wing coloration (grayscale tones) closely match the varying shades of the dry, sandy ground and the dried plant debris. The textured patterns on its body and wings also highly resemble the granular texture of the sand and the irregular lines of the dry vegetation. Furthermore, shadows fall across parts of its body, which helps to break up its outline and blend it with the natural shadows and darker areas of the background. While not completely invisible, it blends in remarkably well, making it difficult to spot at first glance."
