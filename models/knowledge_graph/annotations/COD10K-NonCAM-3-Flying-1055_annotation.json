  "background_description": "The background consists of two main parts: the immediate foreground is a flat, light greyish-beige surface with a slightly grainy or rough texture, likely concrete or stone. Above the butterfly, the background is out of focus and appears as a warm, dark brown/orange, suggesting an overhead surface or wall.",

  "explanation": "The butterfly is prominently displayed against a light greyish-beige surface. Its wings feature distinct patterns of brown, white, and striking orange/red, which stand out significantly against the uniform background. There is a low color similarity and texture similarity between the butterfly and the surface it is resting on. The prominent markings on its wings create a high contrast difference, making it easily visible rather than blending in."
