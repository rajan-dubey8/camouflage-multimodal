  "object_name": "Zebras in dry bushland",
  "background_description": "The environment consists of dry, sparse African bushland. The dominant colors are muted browns, tans, and pale yellows from dry leaves, bare branches, and dry grass. There are numerous thin, intertwined branches and twigs that create a cluttered, vertically and diagonally patterned background. The ground is dry, light brown soil with scattered dead leaves and debris.",

  "camouflage_type": "Disruptive pattern",
  "explanation": "The zebras exhibit disruptive coloration through their distinct black and white stripes. While these stripes create high internal contrast and are not color-matched to the dry bushland, they function as a disruptive pattern. This pattern breaks up the outline of the zebras' bodies, making it difficult for predators to perceive them as a single, coherent form. The surrounding sparse branches and dry foliage further enhance this effect by visually fragmenting the zebras' shapes and blending with the irregular lines of the stripes, especially from a distance or in low light. This makes it harder to distinguish individual animals amidst the cluttered background."
