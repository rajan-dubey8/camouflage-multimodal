  "object_name": "Wet sandy beach at sunset",
  "background_description": "The scene depicts a wet sandy or muddy beach surface, characterized by fine sand ripples and scattered small dark pebbles or debris. A strong golden light from a low sun reflects across the wet surface, creating a bright streak that transitions into darker, more muted tones further from the reflection. The overall color palette ranges from bright golden yellow and orange in the sun reflection to dark browns, greys, and muted greens/golds in the shadowed wet sand.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The image solely depicts a natural environment—a wet sandy beach with a sun reflection. No animals, insects, or fish are visible in the scene, thus there is no organism present to exhibit camouflage. The contrast difference refers to the strong contrast between the bright sunlit reflection and the darker areas of the wet sand."
