  "explanation": "The polar bear exhibits excellent camouflage through color blending. Its white fur closely matches the predominant white color of the snow and ice in its Arctic habitat. This significantly reduces its visual contrast against the background, making it harder for prey to spot it and aiding in stealthy hunting. While its distinct form is visible, the color harmony with the environment is very strong, especially against the snow-covered areas."
