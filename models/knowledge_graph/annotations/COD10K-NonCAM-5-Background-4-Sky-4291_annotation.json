  "background_description": "The background consists of a dynamic sky filled with a mixture of bright, billowy cumulus clouds and darker, shadowed storm clouds. Patches of clear blue sky are visible in the upper left and center. The clouds exhibit varied textures, from soft, diffused edges to more defined, lumpy forms, with areas of strong illumination and deep shadow, creating a visually complex and textured environment.",
