  "explanation": "The Dik-Dik exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its tawny to reddish-brown coat closely matches the dry, sandy soil and the muted colors of the sparse dry grass in its habitat. This coloration allows it to blend seamlessly into its environment, making it difficult for predators to spot. The contrast between the animal and its surroundings is low, enhancing its ability to remain concealed."
