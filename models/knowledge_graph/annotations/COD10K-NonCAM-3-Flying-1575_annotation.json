  "camouflage_type": "Disruptive pattern",
  "explanation": "The bird exhibits camouflage through a combination of color blending and disruptive patterning. Its streaky brown and grey plumage closely matches the muted earthy tones of the woody branches and dead leaves, as well as the shadowy areas within the foliage. The vertical streaks on its feathers also help to break up its outline, making it blend with the vertical lines of twigs and plant stems, a characteristic of disruptive coloration. While the green leaves are a contrasting color, the bird's overall coloration and pattern effectively reduce its visibility against the complex, varied background of its natural habitat."
