  "explanation": "The seal is clearly visible in the image. Its light brown, spotted fur with a lighter belly does not effectively blend with the dark green algae and brown detritus covering the embankment, nor with the greyish-brown water in the background. While seals typically exhibit countershading which can aid in camouflage in open water, in this specific context, resting on the distinctively colored and textured embankment, the animal stands out due to noticeable differences in color, pattern, and texture from its immediate surroundings. There is no mimicry or disruptive patterning that effectively conceals it."
