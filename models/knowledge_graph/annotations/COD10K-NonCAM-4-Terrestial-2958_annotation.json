  "explanation": "The otter is clearly visible against both the tree stump it is resting on and the blurred green background. Its dark, sleek fur does not effectively blend with the rough texture and varied dark tones of the weathered tree stump, nor with the brighter, blurred green foliage. The sharp outline and distinct features of the otter, especially its open mouth and whiskers, ensure it stands out rather than camouflaging into its immediate surroundings."
