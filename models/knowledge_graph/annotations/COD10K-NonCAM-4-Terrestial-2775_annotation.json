  "explanation": "The image features two dark brown sea lion pups resting on a significantly lighter, pebbly beach. Their dark fur creates a high contrast against the pale background, making them stand out prominently. Although some sand is visible on their fur, it does not alter their overall coloration or texture sufficiently to provide any effective camouflage; rather, it highlights their presence against the lighter environment."
