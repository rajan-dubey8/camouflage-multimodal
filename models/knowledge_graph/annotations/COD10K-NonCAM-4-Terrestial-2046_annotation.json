  "explanation": "The sea lion's brownish-tan fur creates a clear contrast against the much lighter, grayish-white rocky background. While sea lions commonly rest on rocks, their coloration does not significantly blend with this specific light-colored, craggy environment. The texture of its smooth fur also differs significantly from the rough, jagged rock surfaces. Consequently, the animal is easily distinguishable, indicating no effective camouflage is present."
