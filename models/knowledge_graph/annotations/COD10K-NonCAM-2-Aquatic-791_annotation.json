  "explanation": "The fish exhibits camouflage through a combination of disruptive patterns and some color blending. Its body features distinct dark vertical stripes that help break up its outline against the visually complex background of branching corals. While the head has a yellowish hue and the eye is bright red, the fins and some iridescent scales display purple and pink tones that partially blend with the surrounding coral colors. The overall patterning helps to obscure its shape, reducing its visibility in the busy reef environment."
