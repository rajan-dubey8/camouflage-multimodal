The surface is textured and uneven, with some areas slightly blurred in the foreground and background, giving a rough, granular appearance.",

  "explanation": "The spider exhibits exceptional camouflage against the sandy, pebbled ground. Its body and legs are covered in a mottled pattern of light grey, dark grey, and black speckles, which almost perfectly replicates the granular texture and varied coloration of the surrounding sand and small stones. The overall sandy-grey hue of the spider blends seamlessly with the dominant colors of the ground. The irregular outline of its splayed legs also helps to break up its form, preventing it from standing out as a distinct shape. The low contrast between the spider and its environment, combined with the precise color and pattern matching, makes it very difficult to spot."
