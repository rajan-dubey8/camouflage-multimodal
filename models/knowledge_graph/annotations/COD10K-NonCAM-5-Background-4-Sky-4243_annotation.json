The sky transitions from a deep blue at the top to a very bright, almost white light source on the left, with scattered elongated white and yellowish clouds. The mid-ground is dominated by numerous multi-story residential and commercial buildings, varying in height and design, mostly in shades of concrete grey and brown, with some darker windows. A distinct modern white building is visible centrally in the mid-ground. The foreground consists of a large, open, dry lot or paved area with sparse, bare trees and shrubs.",
