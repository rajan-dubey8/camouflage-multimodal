  "background_description": "The background consists of a wet, rocky beach or shoreline with numerous pebbles, stones, and larger rocks of various sizes, shapes, and colors. The colors are predominantly earthy tones, including shades of grey, brown, yellow, and some reddish elements (possibly brick fragments). There are also areas of shallow water reflecting a light blue sky, and a larger body of water with gentle waves in the distance.",

  "explanation": "The small bird exhibits effective camouflage on the rocky beach. Its upper plumage is a light brownish-grey, which blends exceptionally well with the varied tones of the wet and dry stones, pebbles, and sand. The bird's white underside provides countershading, helping to reduce the effect of shadows and make it appear flatter against the ground. While its texture is distinct from the smooth or rough rocks, its small size combined with the chaotic and heterogeneous patterns of the rocky environment helps to disrupt its outline and make it difficult to discern. The overall effect is that the bird blends significantly with its environment, requiring close observation to spot it."
