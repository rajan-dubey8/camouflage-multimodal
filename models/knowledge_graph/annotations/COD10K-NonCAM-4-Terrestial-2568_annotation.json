  "explanation": "The giraffe's distinctive patterned coat, with its irregular brown patches separated by lighter lines, serves as a form of disruptive camouflage. This pattern helps to break up the animal's large outline, making it more difficult for predators to identify its shape against the complex background of dappled sunlight and shadows in its natural savanna habitat, especially when standing among trees and vegetation. The colors of the patches also blend well with the natural tones of tree trunks, dry grass, and soil."
