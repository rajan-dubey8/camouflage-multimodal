  "explanation": "The Purple Gallinule exhibits extremely vibrant and iridescent plumage (deep purple, blue-green, and a striking red-yellow beak) that stands out conspicuously against the light blue water and green lily pads of its environment. Its colors are designed for display rather than concealment, making it highly visible and therefore not camouflaged."
