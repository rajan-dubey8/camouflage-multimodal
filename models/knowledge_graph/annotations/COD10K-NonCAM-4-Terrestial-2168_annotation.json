  "explanation": "The lion is clearly visible against the background. Its tawny and darker brown mane colors do not blend with the vibrant green grass or the grey stone wall behind it. While a lion's natural coloring typically provides excellent camouflage in dry grasslands and savanna environments, the artificial and verdant setting in this image prevents any effective concealment. There is a high contrast in both color and texture between the lion and its immediate surroundings."
