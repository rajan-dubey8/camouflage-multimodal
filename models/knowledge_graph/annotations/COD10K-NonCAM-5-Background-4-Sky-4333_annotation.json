  "background_description": "The image captures an expansive aerial view dominated by a bright sunburst on the left, illuminating a blue sky that transitions to a deeper indigo at the top right. Below, a vast blanket of clouds extends to the horizon, with diverse formations ranging from wispy layers to dense, towering cumulus clouds. Some clouds appear bright white where lit by the sun, while others in shadow are dark grey to almost black, indicating significant depth and volume. Atmospheric haze creates a soft, diffused boundary near the distant horizon.",
