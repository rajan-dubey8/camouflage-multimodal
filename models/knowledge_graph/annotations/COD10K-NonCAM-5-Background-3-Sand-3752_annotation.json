In the foreground, there is sandy ground with intricate shadows cast by an overhead tree branch, which is partially visible at the top. A rustic bench made from a weathered wooden plank resting on rough concrete blocks occupies the lower center. Beyond the beach, the ocean stretches out, transitioning from clear turquoise water near the shore to a deeper blue further into the distance. Rocky formations are visible on the right side of the beach. The horizon line is visible, with a faint landmass in the far background under a bright blue sky adorned with scattered white cumulus clouds.",
