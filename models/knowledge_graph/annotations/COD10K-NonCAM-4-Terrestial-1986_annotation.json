  "explanation": "The image features a donkey's face in a prominent close-up, clearly visible and in sharp focus against a blurred background. The animal is not attempting to conceal itself, nor does its coat pattern or coloration actively blend into its immediate environment in a way that suggests camouflage for predator evasion or hunting. Its presence is overt, and there are no visual cues indicating any form of active camouflage."
