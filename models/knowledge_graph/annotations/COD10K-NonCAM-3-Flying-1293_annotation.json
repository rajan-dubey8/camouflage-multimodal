  "explanation": "The Superb Starling in the image exhibits strikingly vibrant and iridescent plumage, featuring brilliant blues, teals, and a contrasting rufous-orange belly, along with patches of white. These vivid colors stand out prominently against the uniform, blurry light brown background. The bird's coloration is clearly designed for display rather than concealment, creating a high contrast with its environment. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
