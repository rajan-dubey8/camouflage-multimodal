  "explanation": "The meerkat exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its fur, a mix of sandy browns, tans, and light beiges, closely matches the warm, earthy, and blurred tones of its background. This natural coloration allows meerkats to blend seamlessly with the dry, sandy, and rocky terrains of their native habitat. While the specific background texture is not distinct due to blur, the overall color palette and the animal's own fur texture contribute to reducing its visibility against typical arid environments, making it harder for predators or prey to spot. The contrast between the animal and its surroundings is low."
