  "explanation": "The tiger exhibits camouflage through its distinctive black stripes on an orange-brown coat, which is a classic example of disruptive pattern camouflage. Although the tiger is clearly visible in this image due to clear focus and frontal view, its natural coloration and stripes are highly effective in its native habitat. The stripes break up the animal's silhouette, mimicking the vertical patterns of tall grasses, tree trunks, and dappled sunlight and shadows in forests and grasslands, making it difficult for prey to perceive its form and movement. The orange-brown fur also blends well with earthy tones and dry vegetation."
