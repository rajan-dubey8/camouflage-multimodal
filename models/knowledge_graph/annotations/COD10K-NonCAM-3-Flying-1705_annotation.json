  "object_category": "Insect",
  "object_name": "Dragonfly",
  "background_description": "The background consists of blurred, dried reeds or plant stems, primarily in shades of light brown, beige, and some muted green tones, suggesting a natural, vegetated environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The dragonfly exhibits striking iridescent blue and purple wings that stand out significantly against the muted brown and beige tones of the dried plant stems it is perched on and the blurred background. Its vibrant coloration and distinct shape do not blend with the environment's colors or textures, indicating a lack of camouflage. The high contrast difference and dissimilar colors/textures confirm that camouflage is not present in this instance."
