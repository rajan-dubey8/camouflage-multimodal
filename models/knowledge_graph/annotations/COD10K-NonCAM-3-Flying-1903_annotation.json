  "explanation": "The birds in the image are clearly visible and do not exhibit any form of camouflage. The first bird has distinct grey, pinkish-tan, and black plumage with a bright orange beak, which contrasts significantly with the blurred green and brown background elements. The second bird is predominantly white with an orange beak, making it highly conspicuous against the background. Their colors and patterns do not blend with or mimic the surrounding environment (green leaves, brown material, dark metal perches), resulting in a high contrast difference and easy detection."
