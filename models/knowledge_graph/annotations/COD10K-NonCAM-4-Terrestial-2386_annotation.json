  "explanation": "The elk exhibits natural color blending camouflage. Its fur, which is a mix of brown and darker brown tones, allows it to partially blend with the surrounding environment. The lighter brown and tan areas of its body show a medium to high color similarity with the dry, yellowish-brown grass in the foreground. The darker fur on its head and neck has a medium color similarity with the shadows and darker green foliage of the evergreen trees in the mid-ground. While its large size and distinct outline prevent perfect concealment, its natural coloration helps to break up its form and reduce its visibility in this specific habitat of dry grasslands and coniferous forests. The contrast difference is medium as the elk is not perfectly hidden, especially against the lighter sky, but its natural hues do integrate with the overall palette of the environment."
