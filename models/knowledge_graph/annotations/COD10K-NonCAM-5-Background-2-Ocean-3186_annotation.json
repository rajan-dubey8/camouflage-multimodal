  "object_name": "Underwater sandy seafloor",
  "background_description": "The image displays an underwater scene with clear, light greenish-blue water. The seafloor is composed of light-colored sand, possibly beige or grayish-tan, which is visibly textured with distinct, parallel ripple marks. These ripples create alternating patterns of lighter, elevated areas and slightly darker, recessed troughs due to the way light and shadows interact.",

  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The image primarily depicts an underwater sandy seafloor with no clearly identifiable animals, insects, or fish. The small, dark specks visible are likely debris or very minor, unidentifiable organisms that do not constitute a main subject for camouflage analysis. Therefore, no camouflage is present as there is no organism to observe in relation to its environment."
