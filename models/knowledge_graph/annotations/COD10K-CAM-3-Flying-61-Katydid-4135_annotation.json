  "background_description": "The background consists of various shades of green foliage, predominantly broad leaves, some with visible veins and slightly textured surfaces. The environment appears dense and lush, with some leaves appearing blurred in the distance, indicating a deep vegetated setting. A small, dark, and somewhat dried stem is visible on the far left, providing a slight contrast, but the immediate surroundings of the Katydid are vibrant green leaves.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Mimicry",
  "explanation": "The Katydid exhibits outstanding camouflage through a combination of color blending and mimicry. Its entire body, especially its large wings, is a vibrant green that almost perfectly matches the color of the surrounding leaves. The texture and shape of its wings strongly resemble a leaf, even featuring what look like leaf veins, which further enhances its ability to blend in. The organism's position on a green leaf and its overall form make it extremely difficult to distinguish from the foliage, demonstrating very low color and texture contrast with its immediate environment. This excellent mimicry of a leaf makes it highly camouflaged."
