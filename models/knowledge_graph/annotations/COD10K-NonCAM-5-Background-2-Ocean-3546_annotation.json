  "object_name": "Stormy ocean with waves",
  "background_description": "The scene depicts a turbulent ocean with large, breaking waves producing a lot of white foam. The water appears dark and choppy. Above the horizon, a dark, overcast sky filled with heavy storm clouds dominates the upper half of the image. A narrow strip of orange-yellow light is visible along the horizon line, possibly indicating a sunset or sunrise breaking through the clouds. A small navigational buoy is faintly visible in the mid-ground.",
