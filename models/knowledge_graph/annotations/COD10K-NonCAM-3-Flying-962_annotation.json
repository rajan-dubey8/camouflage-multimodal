  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of lush green foliage. The leaf directly under the butterfly is sharply in focus, showing its distinct veins and a vibrant green color. Other leaves and branches in the background are out of focus, creating a softer blur of varying shades of green, with some lighter areas suggesting dappled sunlight or distant sky.",

Its colors and patterns do not blend with the surrounding environment, making it easily discernible rather than camouflaged."
