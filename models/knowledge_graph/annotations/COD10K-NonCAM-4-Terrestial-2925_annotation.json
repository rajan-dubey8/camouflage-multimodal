  "explanation": "The Red Deer stag displays a form of natural camouflage through 'Color blending'. Its reddish-brown coat, while not perfectly matching any single element, aligns well with the earthy tones present in its habitat. The brown fur allows it to blend with the dry grass, tree trunks, and soil, reducing its overall visibility against the natural backdrop of the forest edge and grassland. While the antlers and the animal's size make it quite noticeable, its coloration is adapted to help it blend rather than stand out, aiding in evading predators."
