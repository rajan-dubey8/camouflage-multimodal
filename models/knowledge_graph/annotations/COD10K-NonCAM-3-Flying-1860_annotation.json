  "explanation": "The Great Blue Heron is clearly visible against the blurred green and brown foliage background. Its grey-blue plumage provides a distinct contrast, and its sharp form stands out against the soft, out-of-focus environment. While herons possess natural coloration that aids in blending into marshy or reedy environments when stationary, in this context of open flight against a general forest background, no active camouflage mechanism is observed, and the bird is easily detectable."
