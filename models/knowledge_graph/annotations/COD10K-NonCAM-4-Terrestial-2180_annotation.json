  "background_description": "The marmot is resting on a large, rough-textured gray rock that features some lighter patches and hints of green lichen. Surrounding the rock are small patches of green foliage and reddish-brown plant stems. In the blurred background, there are green pine needles and brown branches, indicating a natural, possibly alpine or forest-edge environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The marmot exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its grizzled gray-brown fur on the back and sides closely matches the gray and mottled textures of the rock it is resting upon, as well as the earthy tones in the surrounding sparse vegetation. The yellowish-tan fur on its chest and belly also harmonizes with sunlit or drier areas of the environment. The overall low contrast between the marmot's body and its rocky, vegetated surroundings, combined with the fur's texture that complements the rough rock, makes it blend seamlessly and reduces its visibility to predators or prey."
