  "background_description": "The background consists of dry, sandy-brown soil with sparse patches of yellowish-green and dark green low-lying vegetation. The textures are generally soft and blurred, indicative of a natural, open environment, likely a savanna or grassland.",

  "explanation": "The Steenbok exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-brown fur closely matches the colors of the dry, sandy soil and dried vegetation in the background. This high degree of color similarity, combined with a generally low contrast difference between the animal and its surroundings, allows it to blend seamlessly into its natural habitat. The overall effect makes the animal harder to spot by predators."
