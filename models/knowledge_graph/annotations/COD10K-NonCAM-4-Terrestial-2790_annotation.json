  "explanation": "The red squirrel's greyish-brown body and reddish-brown paws and tail, along with its white belly, provide a significant contrast against the predominantly bright white snow and light-colored, blurred background. While red squirrels' winter coats are typically adapted for blending with tree bark and dormant forest environments, in this specific image, the subject is positioned against a uniform bright snow cover, making it highly visible and not camouflaged."
