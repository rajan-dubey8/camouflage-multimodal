  "explanation": "The tiger exhibits a highly effective disruptive pattern camouflage. Its distinctive black stripes on an orange and white base are designed to break up its body outline, making it difficult to distinguish against the complex patterns of light and shadow found in its natural habitat, such as tall grass, bamboo thickets, and dappled forest floors. The high contrast of the stripes on the tiger's fur itself is crucial for this type of camouflage, mimicking the vertical lines and varied light conditions of its environment. While the overall orange color may stand out against the vivid green foliage in bright light, the stripes' ability to obscure the animal's form in varying lighting and vegetative textures contributes significantly to its camouflage effectiveness."
