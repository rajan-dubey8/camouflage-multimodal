  "background_description": "The image displays a serene ocean sunset. The sky is dominated by vibrant orange and red hues directly around the setting sun, which appears as a bright, glowing orb near the horizon. Towards the edges and upper parts of the sky, the colors fade into softer blue-grey tones with some diffuse clouds. The vast ocean surface is a deep blue-grey, showing gentle ripples and waves. Reflections of the sunset's warm colors are visible on the water's surface, creating streaks of orange and red, particularly in the foreground.",
