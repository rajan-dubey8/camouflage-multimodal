  "background_description": "The background consists of a shallow water seabed or riverbed, composed of coarse sand and small pebbles of varying sizes and colors. The colors include light beige, off-white, light grey, various shades of brown, and occasional darker specks or small green plant fragments. The texture is granular and irregular due to the mixture of sediment types.",

  "explanation": "The flounder exhibits exceptional camouflage in this image. Its flattened body shape allows it to lie flush with the sandy, pebbled substrate. The dorsal surface of the flounder displays a highly variegated pattern of small, irregularly shaped spots and specks in shades of brown, beige, and off-white. This patterning perfectly mimics the mixed colors and granular texture of the surrounding sand and small stones, making it incredibly difficult to distinguish the organism's outline from the background. The color blending and pattern matching are so effective that the contrast difference between the flounder and its environment is remarkably low, allowing it to blend seamlessly."
