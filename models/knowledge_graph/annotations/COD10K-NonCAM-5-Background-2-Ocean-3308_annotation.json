  "object_name": "Small reef fish",
  "background_description": "Underwater coral reef with various brown and reddish-brown coral formations, some appearing lumpy or branching, alongside areas of sandy seabed. The water has a pervasive greenish-blue (teal) hue, reducing clarity and contrast.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "A very small yellowish fish is present in the image. While its diminutive size naturally makes it somewhat inconspicuous in the complex coral environment, its coloration (yellow) does not blend with the predominant dark brown/red corals or the greenish-blue water. There are no patterns or features on the fish that actively contribute to camouflage by mimicking the environment or disrupting its outline. Therefore, it is not considered camouflaged."
