  "background_description": "The scene features a surface composed of large, irregularly shaped pieces of light yellowish-grey rock, heavily textured with numerous small, dark specks and raised bumpy formations, suggestive of fossil inclusions or weathered minerals. These rock pieces are separated by distinct, dark, winding cracks. In the lower part of the image, the rock surface transitions into an area covered with smaller, angular, bluish-grey gravel.",
