  "object_name": "Sandy beach at low tide",
  "background_description": "The background consists of golden-brown wet sand with distinct ripple patterns created by the receding tide. A narrow, shallow channel of water runs through the sand, reflecting the sky. Scattered small, dark pieces of debris and a single white shell are visible on the sandy surface.",

  "explanation": "The image clearly shows a natural environment, specifically a sandy beach at low tide, with no visible organisms (animals, insects, or fish) present. The small objects scattered on the sand are inanimate debris such as a white shell and dark detritus, not living beings exhibiting camouflage behavior. Therefore, no camouflage is detected."
