  "background_description": "The image displays an underwater coral reef environment. It features various types of hard corals, including large plate-like corals and numerous branching corals. The corals exhibit a range of colors from earthy browns and yellows to lighter beige, green-yellowish, and some purplish hues. The water above is a clear blue, and sunlight penetrates to illuminate the reef, creating areas of shadow and light. The textures are varied, from rough, porous surfaces of plate corals to the intricate, branching structures.",
