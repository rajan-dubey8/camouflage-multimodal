  "explanation": "The squirrel's tail and parts of its back are dyed a vibrant blue color. This bright, unnatural coloration creates a strong visual contrast against the muted grey of the asphalt and the green of the foliage, making the squirrel highly conspicuous. While the natural grey fur might offer some minimal blending with the asphalt, the prominent blue acts as a strong anti-camouflage, drawing attention to the animal rather than concealing it. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
