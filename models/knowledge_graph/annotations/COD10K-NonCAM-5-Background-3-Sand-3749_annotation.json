  "explanation": "The image clearly depicts a natural coastal environment comprising a sandy beach, the ocean, and a forested rocky coastline under a cloudy sky. There are no organisms (animals, insects, or fish) visible anywhere in the image that could potentially be demonstrating camouflage. Therefore, camouflage is not present in this scene."
