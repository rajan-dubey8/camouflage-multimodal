  "explanation": "The wolf exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its fur, a mix of grays, whites, and darker patches, closely matches the natural tones of its environment, which includes dry brown/yellow grass, green grass, and shadowed ground. This coloration helps to break up its silhouette and allows it to blend seamlessly with the textured and varied ground cover, making it less noticeable. The varied fur pattern also contributes to reducing its overall distinctness against the busy background, making detection more difficult."
