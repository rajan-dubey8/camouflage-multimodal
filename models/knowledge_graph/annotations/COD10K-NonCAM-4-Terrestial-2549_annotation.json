  "explanation": "The giraffes exhibit a classic disruptive pattern of irregular dark brown patches separated by lighter tan lines. This pattern is a form of camouflage designed to break up their large silhouettes and blend them into the mottled light and shadow of their natural savanna and woodland habitats, particularly against trees and dry vegetation. While standing on lush green grass in this image makes them relatively visible compared to a more ideal savanna background, the pattern still works effectively to disrupt their distinct form. The colors of their coats show medium similarity to the drier earth patches and the more subdued greens and browns of the distant vegetation, and the complex pattern provides some texture similarity with natural, varied backgrounds like tree bark and dappled light. The high internal contrast of the patches is key to achieving this disruptive effect."
