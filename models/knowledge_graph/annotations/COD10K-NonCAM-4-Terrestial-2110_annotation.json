  "explanation": "The brown bear is not camouflaged in this scene. Its dark brown fur, especially in the shadowed areas, creates a high contrast with the much lighter beige/tan surface it is resting on. The distinct furry texture of the bear also differs significantly from the rough, granular texture of the ground. The shape of the bear is clearly outlined against its immediate surroundings, making it easily visible and not blending into the environment."
