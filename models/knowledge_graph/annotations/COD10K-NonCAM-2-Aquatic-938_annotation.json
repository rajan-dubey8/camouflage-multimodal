  "explanation": "The fish, likely a Triggerfish, displays extremely vibrant and high-contrast patterns, featuring bright greenish-blue and vivid orange-yellow stripes. These bold colors and distinct patterns make the fish highly conspicuous against the relatively uniform, dark blue aquatic background. Instead of blending in, its coloration serves to stand out, potentially for warning predators, attracting mates, or asserting territory. Therefore, no camouflage is present; the fish's appearance is designed for visibility rather than concealment."
