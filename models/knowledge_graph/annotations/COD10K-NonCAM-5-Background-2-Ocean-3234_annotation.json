  "explanation": "The image features two people on a bright red inflatable raft in the ocean. The vibrant red color of the raft and the contrasting shapes of the people make them highly visible against the surrounding blue and turquoise water. There is no attempt at blending with the environment in terms of color, texture, or pattern, resulting in a distinct absence of camouflage."
