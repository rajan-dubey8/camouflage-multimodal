  "background_description": "The image captures a dense, old-growth forest, likely a temperate rainforest. Tall evergreen trees dominate the scene, with sunlight filtering through their canopy, creating ethereal rays and dappled light on the forest floor. The ground is heavily carpeted with vibrant green moss, covering rocks, fallen logs, and intertwining roots. Some tree trunks are also covered in moss, and long strands of epiphytic moss hang from branches, adding to the lush, textured environment. The colors are predominantly various shades of green, brown, and golden light.",
