  "background_description": "The background consists of a vibrant green plant with numerous leaves and a few dark brown/black stems or branches. Some leaves are in sharp focus, showing their texture and veins, while others are softly blurred. The overall environment suggests dense foliage, with a bright, out-of-focus light source behind parts of the plant.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The Katydid exhibits strong camouflage through color blending. Its entire body is a vivid green, which closely matches the hue of the surrounding plant leaves. This color adaptation allows it to blend seamlessly into the green foliage, making it difficult for predators to spot. While it is currently perched on a dark stem, which provides some contrast, its natural coloration and somewhat flattened body shape are designed to mimic a leaf, contributing to both color and texture similarity with its preferred leafy habitat. Its large hind legs and long antennae are also present but do not significantly detract from its overall blending with the green environment."
