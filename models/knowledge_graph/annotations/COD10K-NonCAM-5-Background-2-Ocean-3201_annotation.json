  "background_description": "The image depicts a wide expanse of coastal waters under a clear, pale blue sky. In the foreground, the water is a murky reddish-brown, indicative of shallow, possibly muddy or sandy, conditions, with subtle surface ripples. A red and dark grey marker buoy stands in this foreground water. Towards the midground, the water transitions to a darker, more grey-blue hue, meeting the horizon line. Stretching across the distant horizon are numerous white offshore wind turbines, appearing somewhat hazy and blended with the sky due to distance.",
