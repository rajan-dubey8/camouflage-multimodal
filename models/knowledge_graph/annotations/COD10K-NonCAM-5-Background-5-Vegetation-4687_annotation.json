  "background_description": "The image depicts a dense bamboo forest with numerous vertical stalks of varying thickness and shades of green. The foliage is thick, creating a lush canopy, and bright light filters through from above, resulting in strong highlights and some deeper shadows among the bamboo culms. The overall texture is dominated by the smooth, segmented surface of bamboo stalks and the finer patterns of leaves.",
