  "object_name": "Domestic cat",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a vibrant green grassy field with some denser clumps of vegetation and patches of dry, lighter-colored grass. In the foreground, the cat is resting on a grey, textured concrete ledge, partially covered by lush green leaves from an overhead tree branch, which cast shadows.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The cat has a distinct black and white 'tuxedo' pattern. Its dark fur and contrasting white patches stand out sharply against the predominantly green grassy background, the green leaves, and the grey concrete surface it is resting on. There is no color blending or disruptive patterning that would help it merge with the environment. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
