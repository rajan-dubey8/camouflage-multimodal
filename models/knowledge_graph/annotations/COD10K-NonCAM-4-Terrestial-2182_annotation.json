  "background_description": "The background consists of dry, light brown and tan soil, small pebbles, and larger rocky formations. The texture is granular and uneven, reflecting a natural, arid or semi-arid outdoor environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The ground squirrel exhibits effective camouflage through its coloration, which closely matches the earthy tones of the dry soil and rocks in its environment. Its fur, a mix of browns, grays, and tans, blends seamlessly with the granular texture and varied shades of the background, reducing its visibility to predators and prey. The low contrast between the squirrel and its surroundings further enhances this blending."
