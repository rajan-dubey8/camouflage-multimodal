  "background_description": "The scene depicts a wet sandy beach at sunset, with patterns left by receding waves. The sand reflects the pink and orange hues of the sky near the horizon, gradually transitioning to cooler grey-blue further down. The ocean stretches into the mid-ground with soft, blurred waves, appearing calm and reflecting the muted sky. In the distance, a dark, tree-covered landmass or island is visible against the pastel pink and orange gradient of the sunset sky.",
