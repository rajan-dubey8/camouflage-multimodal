  "explanation": "Lions possess tawny to sandy-brown fur, which is a prime example of color blending camouflage, highly adapted for their natural savanna and grassland habitats. This coloration enables them to seamlessly merge with the dry earth, tall grasses, and rocky outcrops, significantly reducing their visibility to both prey and potential threats. In this image, while there is some green grass, the lions' fur color exhibits high similarity with the dry soil and brown foliage in the background, effectively minimizing contrast and providing natural concealment consistent with their ecological role as ambush predators."
