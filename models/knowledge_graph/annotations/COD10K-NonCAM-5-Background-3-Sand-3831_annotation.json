  "background_description": "The image features a rugged coastal landscape. On the right, a large, stratified reddish-brown rocky cliff rises, topped with dense evergreen trees. Below the cliff, numerous dark, algae-covered rocks and boulders are scattered along the intertidal zone, where the ocean waves break. The foreground consists of a wet, golden-brown sandy beach, reflecting the sky and the water. The ocean water is a cool blue-green with white foamy waves crashing onto the shore. In the far distance, another landmass is visible under a clear sky, displaying a gradient from light blue to a warm golden hue, indicative of a sunrise or sunset.",
