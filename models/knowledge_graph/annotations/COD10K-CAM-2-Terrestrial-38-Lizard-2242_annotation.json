  "explanation": "The lizard exhibits excellent camouflage. Its skin features a complex mosaic of greens, browns, and reddish-browns, which perfectly matches the varied coloration of the tree bark and the patches of lichen visible on it. The granular, textured surface of the lizard's skin also remarkably mimics the rough, craggy texture of the bark. Furthermore, the irregular patterns and variations in color across its body help to break up its outline, making it blend seamlessly with its environment and difficult to distinguish from the tree itself. The overall contrast between the lizard and its immediate surroundings is very low."
