Furniture includes a dark wood coffee table, a red chest/cabinet, white and dark wood chairs, a metal-framed daybed with white and patterned pillows, and a white side table. Numerous household objects are present, such as framed pictures, table lamps with beige shades, a television, a laptop, and a large potted plant with green leaves.
