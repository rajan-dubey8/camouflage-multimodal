  "explanation": "The Baltimore Oriole displays striking black and bright orange plumage, which stands out prominently against the reddish-brown wooden bird feeder and the blurred, muted green-blue natural background. These vibrant colors are designed for display and communication rather than for concealment, resulting in a high contrast with its surroundings. Therefore, no camouflage is present in this scene."
