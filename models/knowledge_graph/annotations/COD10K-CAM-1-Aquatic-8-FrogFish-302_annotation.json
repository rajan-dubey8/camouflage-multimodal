  "background_description": "The background consists of a vibrant underwater coral reef. The upper portion shows bright blue ocean water with strong sun rays piercing through the surface. The lower portion features a diverse coral landscape with various types of hard and soft corals, some appearing as bulbous, porous structures in light beige/cream, others as darker, rock-like formations, and some areas with red sponge-like growths or algae.",

  "explanation": "The FrogFish exhibits excellent camouflage by mimicking the surrounding coral reef. Its mottled brownish-orange coloration closely matches the earthy tones and various textures of the rocks, sponges, and corals on the reef floor. Its highly irregular, lumpy body shape and rough skin texture perfectly mimic the porous and uneven surfaces of the hard corals and other benthic organisms, effectively breaking up its outline. The low contrast difference between the FrogFish and its immediate background makes it extremely difficult to distinguish, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the complex environment, appearing much like another part of the reef itself."
