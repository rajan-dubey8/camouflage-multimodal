  "explanation": "The hippopotamus displays a form of color blending camouflage. Its dark gray-brown skin tone closely matches the murky, brownish-green water and the muddy riverbanks that form its natural habitat. While hippos are large animals and not easily 'hidden' in the traditional sense, their coloration provides a degree of crypsis, allowing them to blend into their aquatic environment, especially when submerged or partially submerged. The overall muted color palette of the hippo and its surroundings contributes to a medium color similarity, reducing the contrast and making it less conspicuous in its natural environment, rather than standing out sharply."
