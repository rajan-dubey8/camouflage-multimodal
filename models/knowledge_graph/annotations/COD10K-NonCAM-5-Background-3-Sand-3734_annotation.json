  "background_description": "The image displays a rugged coastal landscape. On the left, a steep, rocky cliff face, composed of grey and brownish rocks, rises, topped with a dense growth of evergreen trees and some deciduous trees displaying autumnal yellow and orange foliage. The foreground features numerous large and small rocks, many covered in vibrant green moss or algae, partially submerged in a smooth, misty-looking body of water, indicative of a long-exposure photograph of the ocean. The water surface extends to the horizon, where two small, dark islands are visible. The sky transitions from a light blue at the zenith to a warm, soft orange-peach hue near the horizon, suggesting either sunrise or sunset.",
