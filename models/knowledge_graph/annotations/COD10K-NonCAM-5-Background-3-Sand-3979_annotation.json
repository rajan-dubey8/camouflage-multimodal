  "background_description": "The image features a dramatic coastal landscape. The foreground and midground are dominated by large, dark grey, rounded rocks, many with distinct pockmarks or indentations, appearing wet from the tide. Some shallow pools of water reflect the overcast sky. The ocean beyond the rocks is a turbulent, deep blue-green, with a smooth, misty appearance due to long exposure. In the distance, snow-capped mountains rise under a heavily cloudy, dark grey sky.",
