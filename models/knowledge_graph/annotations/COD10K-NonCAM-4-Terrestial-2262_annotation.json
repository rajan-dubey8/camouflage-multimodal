  "explanation": "The rhinoceros exhibits effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its thick, wrinkled skin, which is naturally a greyish-brown, is heavily covered in a layer of dust and dried mud. This coating provides a high degree of color similarity with the dry, earthy ground of the background, which is also composed of similar muted brown, grey, and beige tones. Furthermore, the rough, uneven texture of its skin, especially with the caked mud, closely mimics the granular and irregular texture of the surrounding environment. This combination of matching colors and textures results in a low contrast difference, allowing the rhino to blend seamlessly into its surroundings and making it less conspicuous."
