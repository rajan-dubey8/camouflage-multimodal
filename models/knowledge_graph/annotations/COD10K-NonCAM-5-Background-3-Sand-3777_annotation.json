  "background_description": "The image features a bright, sunny beach scene. The foreground shows a foamy white wave receding on light-colored, wet sand. The sand transitions to a dry, light beige further up the beach. The midground consists of a calm, clear ocean with distinct layers of color: a light turquoise near the shore, fading into a deeper blue further out. The horizon is a clear line separating the ocean from a vast, bright blue sky with a single small, wispy white cloud in the upper left.",
