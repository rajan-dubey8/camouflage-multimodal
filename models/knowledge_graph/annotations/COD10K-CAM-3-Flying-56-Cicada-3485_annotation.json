  "explanation": "The Cicada in this image stands out prominently against its background. While its dark body and some parts of its wings share a dark tone with the shadowy leaf litter, the vibrant green coloration on its head, thorax, and leg structures creates a stark contrast. The shiny, somewhat iridescent surface of the Cicada's body also reflects light differently from the dull, textured leaves and needles. Its overall shape and distinct colors do not blend with the natural debris, making it easily detectable."
