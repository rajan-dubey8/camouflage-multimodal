  "background_description": "The background consists of tall, varied savanna grass, with patches of vibrant green in the foreground and mid-ground, interspersed with drier, light brown and beige stalks. Further back, there are green leafy trees and bushes, suggesting a wooded savanna or bushland environment. On the right, dark, gnarled bare branches of a tree are prominent, casting shadows.",

  "explanation": "The Greater Kudu exhibits effective camouflage through its coat coloration and distinctive white stripes. Its grey-brown fur blends well with the muted tones of the dry grasses and tree bark prevalent in its savanna habitat. The vertical white stripes across its body serve as a disruptive pattern, breaking up its large outline by mimicking shafts of light and shadow filtering through dense vegetation or the vertical lines of tall dry grass. This patterning, combined with its overall color, makes it harder for predators to distinguish its form against the varied background of the bushveld, despite being partially visible in direct sunlight."
