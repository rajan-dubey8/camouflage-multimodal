  "explanation": "The zebras display a prominent black and white striped pattern, which is a classic example of disruptive coloration. While the high contrast stripes do not blend with the immediate sandy and rocky environment in terms of color or texture, this pattern is a form of camouflage designed to break up the animal's outline, especially when in a herd or during low-light conditions like dawn or dusk. The stripes make it difficult for predators to distinguish individual zebras from a group or to judge their speed and direction. In this bright, static image, the zebras' pattern creates a high contrast against the background, but the pattern itself is a known camouflage mechanism."
