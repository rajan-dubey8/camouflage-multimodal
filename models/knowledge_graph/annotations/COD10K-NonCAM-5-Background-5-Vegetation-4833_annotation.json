  "background_description": "The scene captures a sunset over a calm body of water, likely an ocean, with the sun low on the horizon casting a bright, warm glow. The sky transitions from intense yellow and orange near the sun to a softer blue-gray at the top, with wispy clouds and faint contrails. In the foreground, a dark, silhouetted hillside covered with trees stands against the luminous horizon and the reflective water surface. The water exhibits a shimmering path of light from the sun's reflection.",
