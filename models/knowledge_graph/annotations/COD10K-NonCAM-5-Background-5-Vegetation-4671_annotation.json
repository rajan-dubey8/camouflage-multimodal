The foreground and midground are covered in dense, dark green trees and bushes, with some prominent taller trees silhouetted against the lighter background. Distant mountains are also heavily forested, appearing dark green to bluish-grey due to atmospheric perspective. A valley or ravine runs through the center, leading the eye deeper into the landscape. The overall palette is dominated by various shades of green, blue, and light grey/white for the sky and clouds.",
