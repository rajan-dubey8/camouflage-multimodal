  "explanation": "The lioness and her cub demonstrate effective camouflage through color blending. Their tawny, sandy-brown fur closely matches the predominant earthy tones of the dry ground in their environment. This coloration helps them to blend seamlessly with the landscape, making them less visible to prey and rivals, especially when stationary or stalking. Although patches of green vegetation introduce some contrast, the overall color scheme of the lions' coats is well-adapted to their typical habitat, providing a significant advantage in concealment."
