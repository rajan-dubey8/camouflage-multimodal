The overall appearance is mottled and speckled, creating a high-contrast black and white or dark brown and white pattern.",

  "explanation": "The Bird, a Snowy Owl, exhibits excellent camouflage against its environment. Its white plumage with distinct black barring and spotting perfectly mimics the mottled pattern of the snowy ground, which is composed of white snow patches mixed with dark earth and fallen leaves. The high contrast within the owl's feathers (white and black) matches the high contrast present in the background (white snow and dark patches). This similarity in color, pattern, and distribution of light and dark areas makes the owl blend seamlessly, disrupting its outline and making it very difficult to distinguish from the surrounding environment."
