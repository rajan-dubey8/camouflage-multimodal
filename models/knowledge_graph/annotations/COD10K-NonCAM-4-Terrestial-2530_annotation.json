  "explanation": "The image shows two hippopotamuses in an environment composed of rocks and water. Hippopotamuses are large, conspicuous mammals with thick, grey-brown skin. In this specific scene, their dark coloration and massive size do not blend with the lighter rock formations or the water. There is no visual attempt at concealment or mimicry, and their distinct form and color make them easily identifiable against the background. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
