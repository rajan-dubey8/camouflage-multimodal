  "explanation": "The fish, identifiable as a Naso Tang, displays vibrant and contrasting coloration with a greyish-blue body, prominent dark blue/black markings on its face and dorsal fin, and bright yellow accents around its mouth, eyes, and tail. These distinct patterns and bright colors make the fish stand out significantly against the muted deep blue water and blurry brown substrate of the background. There is no attempt at blending in with the environment through color or texture matching, nor is there any disruptive patterning that would break up its outline. Its appearance suggests a focus on display or recognition rather than concealment."
