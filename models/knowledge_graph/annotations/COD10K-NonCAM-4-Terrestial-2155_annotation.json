  "explanation": "The coyote exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its fur, a mix of grey, brown, and tan, closely matches the sandy and dusty tones of the desert-like environment. This high color similarity and relatively low contrast difference with the background help the animal blend in, making it less conspicuous to both prey and predators. The fur's texture also somewhat mimics the granular appearance of the ground, aiding in its overall concealment."
