  "object_name": "Lizard",
  "background_description": "The organism is situated on a rocky bank at the edge of a body of water. The bank consists of numerous irregularly shaped, sun-drenched stones with a yellowish-brown and orange hue, interspersed with some darker areas and shadows. Behind the rocks, there are patches of green vegetation and taller dried reeds. The water in the foreground and background is a deep blue, reflecting the sky and distant light.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The lizard exhibits excellent camouflage through color blending with its environment. Its body color, a warm yellowish-brown with orange tones, perfectly matches the sunlit rocks it is resting upon. The textures of its scaly skin and the irregular shapes of its body, including its prominent dewlap, also harmonize with the rough and broken surfaces of the stones, reducing contrast and making its outline less distinct. The overall effect is that the lizard blends seamlessly into the rocky bank, making it difficult to spot at first glance."
