In the foreground, a sandy beach is visible with intricate patterns left by receding water, interspersed with dark, irregularly shaped rocks. The midground features the ocean with gentle waves breaking near the shore, and a prominent rocky cliff face covered in dense evergreen trees. In the distance, another landmass juts out into the sea under an expansive sky filled with wispy, layered clouds. The textures range from smooth sand to rough rock and detailed foliage, with varying shades of grey, black, and white creating depth.",
