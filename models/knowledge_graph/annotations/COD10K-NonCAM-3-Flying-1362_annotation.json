  "object_name": "Hooded Crow",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a light yellowish-brown, slightly textured, curved surface, possibly a concrete barrier or pipe, showing some wear and fine striations. The background is blurred, depicting muted grey and brown urban structures with horizontal lines.",

  "explanation": "The Hooded Crow, with its distinct two-tone black and light grey plumage, stands out clearly against both the light yellowish-brown surface it is perched on and the blurred, muted grey/brown urban background. Its coloration does not blend with the colors or textures of its immediate environment. There is low color similarity, low texture similarity, and a high contrast difference between the bird and its surroundings, indicating a lack of camouflage."
