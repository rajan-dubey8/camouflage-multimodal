  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits effective camouflage through color blending with its environment. Its dark brown and greyish-brown fur colors are very similar to the hues of the tree bark it is resting on. Furthermore, the mottled and somewhat coarse texture of its fur helps it visually integrate with the rough, cracked surface of the bark, breaking up its outline. The low contrast difference between the squirrel and its immediate background makes it difficult to discern at a glance, enhancing its ability to remain inconspicuous in this natural forest setting."
