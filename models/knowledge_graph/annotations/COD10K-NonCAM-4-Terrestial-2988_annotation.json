  "explanation": "The squirrel's reddish-brown fur, a common color for its species, provides a degree of natural camouflage through color blending. This coloration helps it blend with tree trunks, branches, and the earthy tones of the forest floor, including dry leaves. While it stands out against the lighter gravel and bright green grass in this specific scene, its overall coloring is adapted to reduce visibility to predators in its typical woodland habitat. The white underside also serves as a form of countershading, though it creates a distinct contrast against the darker fur and environment from a side view."
