  "explanation": "A grey seal is clearly visible lying on a light sandy beach next to blue ocean water. Its dark grey and mottled fur color contrasts significantly with both the light tan sand and the blue water, making it highly conspicuous. There are no patterns, colors, or textures on the seal that would allow it to blend into this particular environment for camouflage purposes. The seal is not attempting to hide or mimic its surroundings."
