  "background_description": "The image features a deep blue sky, brightest at the center where a light source (sun or moon) is partially obscured by tree branches, creating a luminous glow. The sky transitions from a lighter blue in the center to a darker, almost navy blue towards the edges. The foreground is dominated by the stark, dark silhouettes of tree trunks and a dense network of bare branches, completely obscuring any detail of the trees themselves.",
