  "explanation": "The Mantis exhibits excellent camouflage against the tree bark. Its body coloration is a mottled grey-brown, almost perfectly matching the tone and hue of the bark. Furthermore, the texture of its exoskeleton, particularly the wings and dorsal surface, mimics the rough, bumpy, and fissured pattern of the tree trunk. The low contrast between the mantis and its substrate makes it very difficult to distinguish its outline and form, allowing it to blend seamlessly with its environment through both color blending and pattern matching."
