  "explanation": "The toad exhibits strong camouflage through color blending and texture matching. Its mottled grey-brown and earthy coloration, along with its warty, textured skin, closely matches the dry, pebbly, and dusty ground. This makes the toad difficult to distinguish from its immediate surroundings, as its form, color, and texture seamlessly blend with the small stones and uneven surface of the terrain, reducing its visibility to potential predators or prey."
