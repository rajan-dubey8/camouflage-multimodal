  "explanation": "The toad exhibits strong camouflage through color blending and texture mimicry. Its skin is a mottled mix of earthy browns, dull greens, and yellows, closely matching the colors of the dried leaves and soil it is resting on. The warty, granular texture of its skin also blends seamlessly with the rough textures of the ground and decaying foliage, making its outline less distinct. While its eyes stand out, the rest of its body effectively disappears into the environment, reducing its visibility to predators or prey."
