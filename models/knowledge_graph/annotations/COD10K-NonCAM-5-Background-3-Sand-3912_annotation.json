  "background_description": "The image depicts a tranquil coastal landscape at dawn or dusk. The foreground features foamy white ocean waves breaking gently onto a wide, smooth expanse of light brown to golden-brown sand. The sand appears damp near the waterline, transitioning to a drier texture further up the beach. In the distance, a dark silhouette of palm trees lines the coastline, while the hazy sky above exhibits soft grey and subtle warm tones near the horizon, indicative of low sun.",
