  "background_description": "The image features a canopy of trees, likely plane trees, lining a street. On the left, the trees display vibrant green foliage, while on the right, the leaves transition to warm autumnal shades of orange, red, and brown. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dappled light and shadow. The trunks of the trees are visible, some with light, peeling bark. A bright, clear sky is visible above the canopy, and subtle hints of urban structures or pavements can be seen towards the bottom right.",
