  "explanation": "The image depicts a coastal environment featuring a rough sea, sandy hills, and a lighthouse. No animals, insects, or fish are visible in the scene, therefore camouflage is not present. The lighthouse itself is a man-made structure and is clearly visible against the landscape, indicating it is not attempting to blend in."
