  "object_category": "Bird",
  "object_name": "Fork-tailed Flycatcher",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on thin, bare tree branches that exhibit light brown to orange hues, likely due to warm sunlight. The overall background is a clear, vibrant blue sky with no clouds or foliage.",

  "texture_similarity": "none",
  "contrast_difference": "high",

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bird's distinct black head, greyish back, white underparts, and long, dark forked tail create a clear silhouette against the bright blue sky. Its coloration does not blend with the light brown/orange bare branches or the uniform blue sky, making it highly visible and easily discernible from its surroundings. There are no patterns or colors that would offer concealment through color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning in this environment."
