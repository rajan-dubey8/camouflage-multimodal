  "explanation": "The Tricolored Heron in the image is clearly visible and stands out against the blurred background. Its distinct blue-gray, rufous, and white plumage, along with its prominent outline, do not blend with the light blue sky or the soft green foliage. There is a high contrast difference between the bird and its surroundings, indicating no attempt at camouflage through color blending or disruptive patterns."
