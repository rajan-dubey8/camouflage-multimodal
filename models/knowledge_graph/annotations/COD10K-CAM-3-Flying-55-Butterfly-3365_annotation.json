  "background_description": "The background consists of a dense canopy of green foliage, with various shades of green leaves and some small green berries/buds on slender branches. The foliage in the deeper background is out of focus, creating a soft, blurred green environment, while the foreground leaves are sharper with visible veins and textures. The overall lighting is soft, creating subtle highlights and shadows on the leaves.",

  "camouflage_type": "Mimicry",
  "explanation": "The butterfly exhibits excellent camouflage through mimicry, specifically resembling a leaf. Its closed wings are a light yellowish-green, closely matching the fresh, vibrant green of the surrounding leaves. The shape of its wings, including the slightly pointed tips and the way they are held, perfectly imitates a small leaf. Furthermore, the pattern of veins on its wings is remarkably similar to the venation found on actual leaves, enhancing the illusion. The overall contrast difference between the butterfly and its leafy perch is very low, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from the natural foliage. It blends seamlessly, making it nearly invisible at first glance, relying on both color blending and structural mimicry."
