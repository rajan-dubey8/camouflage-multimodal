  "explanation": "The white-tailed deer buck exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its brown and reddish-brown fur, along with its antlers, closely matches the muted earthy tones of the tree trunks, fallen leaves, and shadowed forest floor. The low contrast between the deer's body and its surroundings, especially in the dappled lighting of the forest, helps to break up its silhouette. While its fur texture is distinct from bark, the overall color harmony makes it blend seamlessly into its natural habitat, making it difficult to spot against the varied backdrop of the forest."
