  "explanation": "The House Sparrow in the image is not camouflaged against the green grass background. Its plumage, consisting of browns, grays, black, and white markings, contrasts significantly with the vibrant green of the grass. There is low color and texture similarity between the bird and its immediate environment, leading to high contrast and easy visibility. While sparrows have disruptive patterns on their feathers, in this specific context, they do not provide effective concealment against the uniform green background."
