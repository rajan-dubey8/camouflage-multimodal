  "background_description": "The image shows an expansive landscape of golden-ochre sand dunes under natural light. The sand surface features intricate, wind-blown ripples, creating parallel lines and textures. Scattered sparse, dry vegetation can be seen on the crests and slopes of some dunes. Distinct human footprints trail across the foreground and midground. The lighting creates varying shades and shadows, emphasizing the undulations of the sand.",
