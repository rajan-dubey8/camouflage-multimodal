  "explanation": "The toad exhibits strong camouflage against its natural environment. Its mottled brown and grey coloration perfectly matches the dark, damp soil and wood chips it is resting upon, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The rough, warty texture of its skin also closely mimics the uneven and granular texture of the surrounding earth and mulch. Furthermore, its low-profile, squat shape, combined with the irregular contours of the ground, helps to disrupt its outline, preventing it from standing out visually. The overall contrast difference between the toad and its immediate surroundings is very low, contributing to its excellent blending."
