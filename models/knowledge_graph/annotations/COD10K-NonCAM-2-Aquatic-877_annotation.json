  "explanation": "The Porcupinefish exhibits strong camouflage through a combination of disruptive patterns and color blending. Its body is covered in mottled brown, grey, and yellowish-orange tones with distinct dark spots, which closely match the murky, particle-filled aquatic background. The irregular dark spots and varied coloration break up the fish's outline, making it difficult to discern its shape against the similarly textured and colored environment. The rough, spiny texture of the fish further enhances its ability to blend with rocky or coral structures, reducing its visibility to predators or prey."
