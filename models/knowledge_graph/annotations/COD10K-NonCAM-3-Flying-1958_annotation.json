  "explanation": "The House Sparrow is highly visible and stands out against its background. Its distinct plumage, featuring contrasting shades of brown, black, white, and gray, does not blend with the blurred green leaves or the light blue sky. There is no significant color or texture matching between the bird and its environment, nor does it display any disruptive patterns or mimicry to aid in concealment. The bird is clearly the focal point and easily identifiable."
