  "object_name": "StarFish",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a rocky intertidal surface covered with a variety of marine life. This includes numerous small, light-colored barnacles, patches of dark green algae, and extensive areas of brown and reddish-brown seaweed (likely kelp or rockweed). The rock itself appears light grey or tan where visible, with some sandy or gritty textures.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The StarFish in this image is highly visible and does not blend with its environment. Its prominent deep reddish-purple color with distinct white raised patterns stands out significantly against the predominantly brown, green, and light tan/grey hues of the rocky substrate, barnacles, and seaweed. There is a strong contrast in both color and texture between the organism and its surroundings. The starfish's unique shape and bumpy texture are also distinct from the smooth rock, irregular seaweed, and granular barnacle clusters, further preventing any camouflage effect."
