  "object_name": "Open ocean with sun glare",
  "background_description": "The image captures a vast expanse of open water, likely an ocean or large sea, under a bright, hazy sky. A powerful sun is prominently visible, creating an intense glare path that stretches across the rippling water surface, reflecting off the numerous small waves. The water in areas not directly hit by the sun's reflection appears dark blue-green, while the sky is a muted, light blue-grey, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon.",
