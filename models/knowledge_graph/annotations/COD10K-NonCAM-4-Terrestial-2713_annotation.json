  "background_description": "The background consists of tall, primarily green and some dried yellowish-green grasses, characteristic of a savanna or grassland environment. The textures are mostly linear from the blades of grass, with some areas appearing more blurry in the distance, indicating depth. The lighting is natural and even.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The Hartebeest displays color blending as a form of camouflage. Its reddish-brown to tawny fur color closely matches the dry and green grasses and earth tones prevalent in its savanna habitat. This allows the animal to effectively blend into its surroundings, reducing its visibility to predators. While the horns are distinctive, the body coloration creates a low contrast with the environment, enhancing its overall concealment."
