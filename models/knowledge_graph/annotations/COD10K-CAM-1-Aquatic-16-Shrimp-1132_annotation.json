  "background_description": "The background consists of a shallow water environment with a mixture of light-colored, granular sand and rough, textured rocks. Some rocks appear wet and darker, possibly with some algae growth. There are areas of clear water reflecting light, and darker areas indicating deeper water or shadows. The overall environment is mottled with various shades of light brown, grey, and hints of green.",

  "explanation": "The shrimp exhibits strong camouflage through both color blending and pattern matching. Its body is translucent with a mottled pattern of white speckles on a greenish-brown base. This coloration closely mimics the varied tones and textures of the sandy, rocky, and slightly algae-covered substrate in the shallow water. The white speckles help to break up the shrimp's outline and blend with the brighter sand grains and reflective surfaces, while the darker, more translucent areas align with the shadowed or wet parts of the rocks and sand. This effectively reduces the visual contrast between the organism and its complex natural background, making it difficult to discern upon casual inspection."
