  "background_description": "The cicada is perched on a thick, gnarled tree branch that is dark brown with visible rough textures, bumps, and lighter weathered patches. Behind and below the branch, there are soft-focus, blurry areas of vibrant green and yellowish-green, indicative of distant foliage or leaves. Some distinct, light-green, needle-like leaves or fronds hang down near the cicada's wings.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The cicada exhibits good camouflage primarily through color blending and strategic positioning. Its dark, robust body closely matches the dark brown and shadowed tones of the tree branch it is clinging to. The rough texture of its exoskeleton also provides a moderate similarity to the coarse bark of the branch. The cicada is positioned on the underside of the branch, which naturally places it in shadow, further reducing its visibility and blending its form with the darker areas of the bark. While its translucent wings are somewhat lighter and stand out slightly against the dark branch and the vibrant green background, the main body mass is well-integrated visually, making it difficult to spot at first glance."
