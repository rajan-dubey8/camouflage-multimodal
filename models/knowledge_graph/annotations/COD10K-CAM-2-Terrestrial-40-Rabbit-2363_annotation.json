  "explanation": "The two rabbits in the image appear predominantly white, likely indicating they are species like the Mountain Hare (Lepus timidus) in their winter coat. In this specific image, the environment is devoid of snow, consisting instead of dry, golden-brown grasses and dark brown heather. The stark white coloration of the rabbits creates a high contrast against the dark and earthy tones of the background, making them highly conspicuous and easily detectable. While this white coat would offer excellent camouflage in a snowy landscape, it provides no concealment in the current brown and green environment."
