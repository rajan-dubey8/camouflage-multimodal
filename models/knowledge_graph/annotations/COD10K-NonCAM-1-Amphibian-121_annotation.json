  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The common toad exhibits natural camouflage characteristics, including earthy brown and mottled coloration with darker spots and a textured, warty skin. These features are designed for color blending with elements like soil, leaf litter, and muddy banks. While the toad inherently possesses these camouflage adaptations, its effectiveness is somewhat reduced in this particular image due to the vibrant green grass and the highly contrasting bright blue background (likely sky or water). The toad's coloration does not blend well with the bright green or blue, resulting in low color and texture similarity and a high contrast difference in this specific setting, making it moderately visible despite its natural camouflage strategy."
