  "explanation": "The bird, identified as a Great-tailed Grackle due to its distinctive dark plumage, bright yellow eyes, and blue-grey beak, stands out prominently against the muted, blurry greyish-brown background. Its dark feathers provide a strong contrast against the lighter background, and its brightly colored eyes and beak further draw attention. There are no patterns, colors, or forms on the bird that mimic or blend with the surrounding environment, indicating a clear lack of camouflage."
