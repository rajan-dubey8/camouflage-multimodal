The sand exhibits warm tones ranging from light beige to deep orange and brown, with soft shadows creating definition and highlighting the curves and peaks of the dunes. The surface of the sand shows subtle textures, likely from wind patterns, and a hazy quality, possibly due to dust or atmospheric conditions, contributes to the overall soft, muted appearance of the environment.",
