  "background_description": "The cat is positioned inside a large, open cardboard box. The interior of the box is deeply shadowed, creating a dark, almost black, background for the cat. The visible exterior and edges of the box are light brown corrugated cardboard, featuring various black and red printed text, symbols (like 'Petlove', 'M', arrows, fragile glass, and umbrella icons), and paw prints. To the right, a wooden floor with a herringbone pattern is visible, along with a person's arm or leg in the foreground.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The black cat is highly camouflaged within the deep shadows of the cardboard box. Its dark fur color blends almost perfectly with the dark interior, effectively obscuring its body shape and outlines. This demonstrates strong color blending and shadow hiding, making the majority of the cat's form nearly invisible. The only elements that significantly break the camouflage are its bright, luminous green eyes, which stand out sharply against the darkness, revealing its presence despite the otherwise excellent concealment."
