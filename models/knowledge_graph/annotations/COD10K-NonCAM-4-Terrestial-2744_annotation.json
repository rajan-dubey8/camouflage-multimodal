  "explanation": "The rhinoceros displays a natural form of camouflage through color blending. Its thick, wrinkled grey-brown skin closely matches the dusty, earthy tones of the ground in its environment. This high color similarity helps the large animal blend into its surroundings, particularly in areas with shadows or less direct lighting. While its significant size and prominent features mean it doesn't disappear completely, its coloration reduces its overall visual contrast against the natural landscape, contributing to crypsis."
