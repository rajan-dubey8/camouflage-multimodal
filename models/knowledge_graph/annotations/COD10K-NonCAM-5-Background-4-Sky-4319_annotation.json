  "background_description": "The image displays a vast expanse of sky, transitioning from a soft, muted grayish-blue at the top to a lighter, more ethereal shade towards the horizon. Scattered across this backdrop are delicate, wispy clouds, likely cirrus or cirrocumulus formations. These clouds are illuminated by a warm, golden-orange light, indicative of either sunrise or sunset, creating a striking contrast against the cooler tones of the sky. The cloud formations are elongated and feathery, with varying densities and a distinct, soft texture.",
