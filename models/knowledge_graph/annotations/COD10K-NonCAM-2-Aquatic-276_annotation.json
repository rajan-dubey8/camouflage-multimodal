  "explanation": "The image clearly shows a pufferfish with a distinct body shape and prominent intricate dark patterns over a lighter base, along with a yellow underside. It is resting on a pebbly seabed with a deep blue background. The fish's unique patterns and colors, especially the yellow belly and dark markings, create a strong contrast against the sandy, pebbly bottom and the blue water, making it highly visible. There is no visual evidence of the fish attempting to blend into its immediate surroundings."
