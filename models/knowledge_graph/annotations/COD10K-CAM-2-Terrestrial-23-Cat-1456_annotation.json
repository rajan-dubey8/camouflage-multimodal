  "object_name": "Cat",
  "background_description": "The cat is situated on a light-colored, possibly tiled or polished concrete, floor, partially hidden under a wooden dining chair. The background consists of multiple light brown, polished wooden chair legs, creating a frame around the cat. Behind the cat, there is a dark, shadowy recess with some light-colored rectangular objects (possibly storage containers or boxes) visible in the deeper background. The overall lighting suggests an indoor setting with diffused light from the front, casting the area under the chair in shadow.",

  "camouflage_type": "Shadow hiding",
  "explanation": "The cat is partially concealed by the shadow and the legs of the wooden chair, which provides some physical obstruction and takes advantage of a darker area. It is lying low to the ground, which helps reduce its overall profile. However, its distinct calico fur pattern, featuring prominent white, orange/ginger, and dark patches, does not blend effectively with the colors or textures of its immediate environment. The white patches, in particular, create a noticeable contrast against the deep shadows and the darker wooden tones of the chair, making the cat clearly visible despite its attempt to hide in the dark recess. While it uses the shadow for concealment, its fur itself does not provide color or pattern matching camouflage."
