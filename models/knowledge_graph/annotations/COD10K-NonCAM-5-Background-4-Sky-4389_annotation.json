Beyond the water, there is a band of green and brown reeds or tall grasses, followed by a dense line of diverse trees, some with dark green foliage and others appearing deciduous or palm-like in the distance. The sky above transitions from a light blue at the zenith to soft pinks and oranges near the horizon, typical of dusk, with scattered cumulus clouds tinged with pink.",
