  "background_description": "The scene depicts a hotel room with two beds. The beds are made with white sheets and duvet covers, topped with a mustard-yellow or gold-colored bed runner with a subtle grid texture. Several pillows are arranged on the beds, some white and some with light striped patterns. The headboards are made of warm-toned wood, matching a bedside table in between the beds which holds a lamp, a telephone, and a tissue box. The walls behind the beds are also a warm, solid color, likely painted or wallpapered. The carpet visible on the floor features stripes of varying shades of blue and green.",
