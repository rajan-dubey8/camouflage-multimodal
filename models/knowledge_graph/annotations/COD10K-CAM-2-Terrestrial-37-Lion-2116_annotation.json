  "explanation": "The lion in this image demonstrates effective camouflage, primarily through color blending. Its tawny, yellowish-brown fur color closely matches the dominant color of the dry, withered grass that makes up most of the background. This high color similarity makes it difficult for the eye to distinguish the lion from its surroundings at first glance. Although the texture of its fur is smoother than the wispy, linear texture of the grass, the tall grass also helps to partially obscure the lion's shape, breaking up its outline. The contrast difference between the lion and the grass is low, further aiding its concealment. The lion is positioned low in the grass, enhancing its ability to blend in and remain unnoticed."
