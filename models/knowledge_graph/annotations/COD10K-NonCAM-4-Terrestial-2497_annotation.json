  "explanation": "The young deer exhibits camouflage primarily through a disruptive pattern. Its fur is a brownish-grey color, closely matching the earthy tones and dried vegetation found in the natural environment. More notably, its back is covered with lighter spots and speckles. This pattern effectively breaks up the animal's outline, making it harder to discern from the patchy light and shadow, as well as the varied textures of the surrounding grass and foliage. The overall color also blends well with the greens and browns of the habitat, further aiding in concealment."
