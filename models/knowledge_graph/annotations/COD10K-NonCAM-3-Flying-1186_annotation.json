  "explanation": "The birds are dark brown with a distinct light gray cap, creating a strong contrast against the clear, light blue sky and the bright white rope they are sitting on. Their dark plumage and well-defined forms make them highly visible, indicating no attempt at blending with their immediate environment for concealment. There are no patterns or coloration that would help them merge with the sky or the rope."
