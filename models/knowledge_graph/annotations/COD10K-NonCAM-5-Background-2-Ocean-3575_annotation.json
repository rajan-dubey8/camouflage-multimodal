  "object_name": "Ocean and sky landscape from a cliff",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a bright blue sky with scattered white cumulus clouds at the top. Below the horizon, a vast expanse of deep blue ocean dominates, transitioning to clearer, turquoise water closer to the foreground. The foreground itself shows the edge of a cliff with dry, golden-brown grasses and some white rocky outcrops, with the shallow, clear water revealing a rocky seabed with dark coral or rock formations.",
