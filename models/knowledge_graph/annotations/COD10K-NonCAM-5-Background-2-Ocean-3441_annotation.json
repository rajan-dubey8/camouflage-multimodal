  "background_description": "The image displays a vast expanse of the ocean under a clear, bright blue sky. Numerous waves are visible, cresting and breaking into white foam as they move towards the viewer. The water itself is a deep blue-green, reflecting the light and showing variations in tone. The horizon line where the sea meets the sky is slightly hazy. The textures vary from the smooth surface of the water in calmer sections to the turbulent, frothy texture of the breaking waves.",
