  "background_description": "The image features a dramatic sunset sky. The upper portion shows a clear, light blue sky, gradually transitioning to a warmer, golden-orange hue towards the horizon. Prominent cumulus clouds dominate the mid-sky, intensely illuminated in shades of bright orange, yellow, and red by the setting sun, with some darker greyish areas. Below the horizon, a silhouette of a landscape is visible, including dark mountains, dense trees, and urban elements such as a street lamp and parts of buildings or structures on the left and right.",
