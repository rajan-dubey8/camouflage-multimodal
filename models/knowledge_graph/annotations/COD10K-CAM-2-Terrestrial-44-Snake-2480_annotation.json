  "background_description": "The background is primarily composed of the rough, deeply textured bark of a tree, characterized by fissures, ridges, and various shades of grey, brown, and dark tones. A prominent dark hollow or cavity is present in the center. Beneath the hollow and to its left, there are reddish-brown rocky or earthy surfaces. The environment has a complex, irregular texture with significant natural shadows and highlights.",

  "explanation": "The snake is highly camouflaged in this image. Its scales display a mottled pattern of grey and brown tones that remarkably blend with the colors and patterns of the surrounding tree bark and the shadowy crevices. The snake is positioned partially within a dark hollow, allowing it to utilize **shadow hiding** to further obscure its form. The intricate and irregular texture of the tree bark, combined with the snake's own patterned skin, contributes to excellent **pattern matching**, making its outline difficult to discern against the complex background. The overall **contrast difference** between the snake and its immediate environment is low, which prevents it from standing out visually."
