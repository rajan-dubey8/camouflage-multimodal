  "background_description": "The scene depicts a dry landscape with a large, dark tree trunk and bare branches silhouetted against a pale blue sky, which transitions into a hazy, smoke-filled midground. The foreground is dominated by dry, brownish-yellow grasses and low vegetation engulfed in bright orange and red flames. Dense grey smoke billows upwards, partially obscuring the distant trees and sky.",
