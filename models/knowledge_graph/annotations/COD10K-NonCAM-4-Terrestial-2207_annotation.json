  "explanation": "The ground squirrel demonstrates effective camouflage primarily through color blending. Its fur exhibits a natural palette of grays, browns, and sandy tones, which precisely matches the dry, rocky, and earthy colors of its habitat. The mottled fur pattern and the lighter stripe on its side further aid in disrupting its outline, helping it to merge with the irregular textures and shadows of the ground. This combination of color matching and subtle pattern disruption makes the squirrel difficult to spot against its natural background, providing protection from predators."
