  "explanation": "The bird exhibits color blending camouflage. Its plumage, consisting of muted greyish-blue tones on its head and back, and soft greenish-yellow/cream on its underside, allows it to somewhat blend with the natural environment. The grey-brown tones on its back and wings align with the colors of the branch it's perched on, while the greenish-yellow parts can harmonize with the dappled light and green hues of the surrounding foliage. Although the bird is clearly visible due to good lighting and some contrast, its overall coloration is designed to reduce conspicuousness in its natural habitat, rather than standing out starkly against the greens and browns."
