  "explanation": "The image features a vibrant coral formation displaying intense red-orange hues with bright, glowing blue accents. This coloration stands in stark contrast to the dark, muted background, making the coral highly conspicuous. Its distinctive lumpy and textured surface further enhances its visibility, preventing any form of camouflage. The coral is clearly not attempting to blend into its environment; rather, its appearance is designed to be prominent."
