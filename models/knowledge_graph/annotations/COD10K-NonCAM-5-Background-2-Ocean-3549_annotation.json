  "background_description": "The scene depicts a serene coastal environment at sunset. The sky is a vibrant tapestry of deep purples, lavenders, pinks, and oranges, with subtle cloud formations. The sun, a bright red-orange orb, is low on the horizon, casting a vivid reflection across the calm water surface. The water mirrors the dramatic colors of the sky, appearing in shades of purple and pink with orange highlights. A dark, silhouetted landmass, possibly an island or distant coastline, stretches across the mid-ground on the left, with a smaller, darker rock formation visible closer to the foreground.",
