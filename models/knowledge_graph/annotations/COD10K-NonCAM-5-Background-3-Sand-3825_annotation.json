  "background_description": "The image features a vast desert landscape with prominent sand dunes under a clear sky. The sand exhibits a warm, golden-beige hue, characteristic of desert environments, and shows intricate ripple patterns and textures created by wind, casting long shadows that emphasize the terrain's contours. Footprints are visible on the sand, indicating human presence. Several dry, weathered tree branches or shrubs are sparsely scattered on top of one of the dunes. The sky is a clear gradient of blue, transitioning from lighter shades near the horizon to deeper blue overhead.",
