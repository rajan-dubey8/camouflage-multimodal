  "background_description": "The image depicts a vast agricultural landscape under a dramatic, heavily clouded sky. The sky transitions from a dark, almost black hue at the top, to lighter shades of grey and white storm clouds in the mid and lower sky, suggesting inclement weather. The rolling fields below are covered with what appears to be stubble or sparse vegetation, showing distinct lines or patterns of cultivation. The overall scene is monochromatic, primarily in shades of grey and dark blue-grey.",
