  "background_description": "The image displays a sky filled with a mixture of dark, heavy cumulus clouds and lighter blue sky patches. The clouds vary in density and shade, ranging from deep grays and blues in the more opaque formations to brighter whites where sunlight pierces through or reflects off their edges. Streaks of wispy cirrus-like clouds are also visible in the lighter blue areas of the sky. The overall scene shows a dynamic interplay of light and shadow, characteristic of a cloudy day.",
