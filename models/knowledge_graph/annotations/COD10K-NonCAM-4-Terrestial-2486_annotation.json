  "explanation": "The grey squirrel exhibits moderate camouflage through color blending. Its grey body fur, white belly, and reddish-brown tail with grey highlights blend reasonably well with the natural, warm, earthy tones of its typical habitat (implied by the blurred background, likely tree trunks or dried leaves). While it is sitting on a contrasting man-made surface, its overall coloration helps to break up its outline and reduce its visibility in a natural, woody environment against potential predators or prey. The varied texture of its fur also adds to this effect."
