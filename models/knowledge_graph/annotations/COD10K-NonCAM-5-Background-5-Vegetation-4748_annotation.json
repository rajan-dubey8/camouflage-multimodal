  "object_name": "Moss and lichen covered branch",
  "background_description": "The background is very dark, almost black, and completely out of focus, creating a deep, obscure backdrop. The foreground features a thick tree branch densely covered with a variety of moss and lichen, exhibiting textures ranging from soft, feathery growths to more coarse, fibrous patches. The colors are predominantly vibrant yellowish-green and olive-green, with some brownish tones, particularly in the more shadowed crevices. The branch is illuminated by a direct light source, creating highlights on the moss and casting parts of the branch into shadow.",
