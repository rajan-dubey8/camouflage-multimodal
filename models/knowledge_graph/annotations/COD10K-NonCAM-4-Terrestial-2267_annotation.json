  "explanation": "The American Bison exhibit a form of natural camouflage through color blending. Their dark brown, shaggy fur, while creating a noticeable contrast in shade with the lighter dry grass in the foreground, shares the overall earthy and muted tones of their grassland habitat. This coloration helps them blend into the natural environment, especially from a distance or in varying light conditions, making them less conspicuous to predators. Although their large size and dark hue create some visible distinction against the light beige grass in this particular scene, their natural coloring is an adaptation to blend with the dirt, trees, and general muted palette of their native plains. The texture of their fur, however, does not closely mimic the wispy grass."
