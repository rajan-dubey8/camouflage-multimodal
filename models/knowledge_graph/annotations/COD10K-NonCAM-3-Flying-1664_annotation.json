  "object_name": "European Starling in flight carrying prey",
  "background_description": "The background is highly blurred with a bokeh effect, consisting of indistinct dark shadowy areas mixed with lighter, hazy vertical streaks. This suggests a distant, out-of-focus environment, possibly a mix of foliage and man-made structures under varying light conditions.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The European Starling is clearly visible and brightly illuminated against a dark, blurred background. Its iridescent and spotted plumage, though complex, does not blend into this specific environment; instead, the lighting creates a high contrast, making the bird stand out significantly. The bird is captured in active flight, prominently highlighted, indicating no attempt at camouflage in this visual context."
