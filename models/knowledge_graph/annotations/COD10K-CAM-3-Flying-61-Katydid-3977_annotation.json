  "object_name": "Katydid",
  "background_description": "The background consists of dense green foliage, primarily large leaves and slender stems. Some leaves are brightly lit by direct sunlight, revealing detailed venation and lighter green hues, while others are partially shaded, appearing darker. The textures vary from smooth leaf surfaces to slightly fuzzy stems, creating a natural plant canopy.",

  "camouflage_type": "Mimicry",
  "explanation": "The Katydid exhibits outstanding camouflage through a highly effective form of mimicry. Its entire body, particularly its large wings, is colored an almost identical shade of green as the surrounding leaves, providing excellent color blending. Crucially, the intricate vein patterns on its wings precisely mimic the venation found on real leaves, adding a remarkable layer of detail to its disguise. Its flattened body shape further enhances the illusion of being a leaf. This combination of color matching, pattern replication, and shape mimicry results in a very low contrast difference with the environment, making the Katydid extremely difficult to distinguish from the foliage it rests upon."
