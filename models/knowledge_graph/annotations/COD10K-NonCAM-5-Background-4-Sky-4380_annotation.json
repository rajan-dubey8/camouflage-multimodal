  "background_description": "The scene features a dramatic and intense sky with dark, heavy storm clouds partially illuminated by a bright, golden-orange light, indicative of either sunrise or sunset. Below the tumultuous sky, snow-capped mountains stretch across the horizon, their peaks dusted with white. In the foreground, a rugged, dark rocky shoreline, covered in a thin layer of snow, meets a calm body of water, likely a fjord or large lake, which reflects the somber light of the sky. The overall environment is cold, wild, and rugged.",
