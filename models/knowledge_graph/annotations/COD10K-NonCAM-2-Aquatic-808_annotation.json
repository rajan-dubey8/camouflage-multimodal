  "explanation": "The pufferfish displays a distinct camouflage strategy through its coloration and patterning. Its body is a vibrant yellow-green, overlaid with intricate, dark, wavy lines and spots. This serves as disruptive coloration, a type of camouflage designed to break up the fish's outline and shape against a complex background, such as coral reefs or rocky substrates, making it harder for predators or prey to discern its form. While the fish's bright color contrasts significantly with the plain dark blue-grey background in this specific image, indicating low direct color and texture similarity to the immediate environment, the presence of these complex patterns is a clear biological adaptation for camouflage. The high contrast in this particular shot means it's not optimally camouflaged here, but the pattern itself is inherently a camouflage mechanism."
