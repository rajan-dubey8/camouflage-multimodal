  "explanation": "The Blue Jay exhibits strikingly vibrant blue, black, and white plumage, which creates a high contrast against the green, blurred forest background and the light-colored, textured tree bark. Its distinct coloration makes it highly conspicuous rather than blending in with its natural environment. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
