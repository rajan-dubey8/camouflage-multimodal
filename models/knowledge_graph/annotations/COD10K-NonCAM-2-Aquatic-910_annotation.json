  "background_description": "The background features a sandy seafloor in the foreground with fine, light-colored grains. Behind the fish, a large, dark, heavily textured rock formation dominates the mid-ground. The water above is a clear, deep blue, and a blurry, smaller yellow-finned fish is partially visible behind the main subject.",

  "explanation": "The fish displays effective camouflage primarily through its disruptive pattern and color blending. Its body is covered in irregular reddish-orange and white blotches, which break up its outline against the varied textures and tones of the sandy bottom and the dark, textured rock formation. While its overall color tone is somewhat distinct from the very dark rock, the blotchy pattern and lighter patches (especially on its underside) allow it to blend with the lighter sand and the varied, irregular surfaces of its habitat, making it less conspicuous to both predators and prey."
