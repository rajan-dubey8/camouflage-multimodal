  "background_description": "The coyotes are situated in a natural environment featuring a mix of dry, pale brown and gray reeds and sparse grass in the immediate foreground and mid-ground, surrounding shallow water or muddy patches. Beyond them, the background transitions to denser, vibrant green grass and foliage. The overall scene suggests a marshy or riparian area.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The coyotes exhibit effective camouflage through color blending. Their tawny, sandy-brown fur with grayish undertones closely matches the muted browns and grays of the dry reeds and the exposed muddy/sandy ground around the water. This natural coloration helps them blend seamlessly with the prevalent earthy tones of their immediate surroundings, reducing their visibility to prey and predators. Although the vibrant green grass in the background provides some contrast, their position amongst the drier elements and reeds significantly enhances their concealment."
