  "explanation": "The gorilla's dark grey fur, while naturally suited for blending into the shadows of its forest habitat, does not provide effective camouflage in this specific brightly lit scene. The direct sunlight strongly illuminates the gorilla's back and head, creating significant highlights that contrast sharply with the shadowed parts of its body and the background. Its large size and distinct silhouette are clearly visible against the blurred natural background, which consists of both dark logs and lighter, sun-dappled ground, none of which perfectly match the gorilla's coloration or texture to obscure its presence. The small orange leaf in its mouth is also a highly contrasting element."
