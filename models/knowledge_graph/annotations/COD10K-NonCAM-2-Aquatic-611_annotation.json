  "explanation": "The image clearly displays a Humpback Unicornfish, identifiable by its distinct body shape, bluish-grey coloration, and yellow accents on its fins. It is swimming in an open coral reef environment. The fish's colors and patterns, especially the bright yellow markings, do not blend with the surrounding corals or water, indicating a clear absence of camouflage. Its form and color stand out distinctly against the background."
