  "object_name": "Toad",
  "background_description": "The background consists of dry, straw-like grass mixed with some greener blades and loose soil/leaf litter in the foreground. Behind the toad, a very large tree trunk with textured, rough bark covered in white and yellow lichens rises sharply upwards, leading to a canopy of lush green leaves against a bright sky. Further in the background, there's a small wooden shed and more trees on a gentle slope.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Pattern matching",
  "explanation": "The toad exhibits strong camouflage through color blending and pattern matching. Its mottled skin, featuring shades of brown, olive green, and dark earthy tones, closely matches the surrounding dry grass, soil, and scattered organic debris. The irregular patterns on its back break up its silhouette, making it difficult to distinguish from the varied textures and shadows of the ground cover. The low contrast between the toad's body and its immediate environment further enhances its ability to blend in, making it a challenging subject to spot despite its relatively large size when viewed up close."
