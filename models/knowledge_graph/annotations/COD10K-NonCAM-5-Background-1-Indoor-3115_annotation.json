  "background_description": "The image depicts a well-lit modern hotel room. The wall behind the bed features a decorative stacked stone or slate texture in varying shades of light brown and grey. The floor is covered with a textured brown carpet that has lighter, abstract patterns. Beyond a large window, a blurry outdoor scene shows a landscape with bare trees, suggesting a winter or early spring setting, with a generally grey sky. The room contains a large bed with a cream-colored upholstered headboard, white bedding, and a dark brown throw blanket. Two light-colored armchairs and a small dark table are positioned near the window.",
