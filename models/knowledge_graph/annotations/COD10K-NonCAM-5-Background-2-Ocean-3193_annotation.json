  "object_name": "Shallow water with pebbles",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a clear body of water flowing over a bed of numerous smooth, rounded pebbles and small rocks. The stones vary significantly in size, shape, and color, exhibiting a natural palette of earthy browns, greys, whites, reds, and some green hues. The water's surface is lightly rippled, causing light refraction and distortion, which creates dynamic patterns and shimmering effects over the textured stone bed.",
