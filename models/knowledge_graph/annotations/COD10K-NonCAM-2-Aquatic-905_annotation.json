  "explanation": "The image features a bright golden-yellow Koi fish. Koi fish are ornamental, selectively bred for their striking colors and patterns, not for blending into their natural environment. This specific fish's vibrant yellow hue creates a high contrast against the dark green water background, making it highly visible and easily detectable. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning to conceal its presence."
