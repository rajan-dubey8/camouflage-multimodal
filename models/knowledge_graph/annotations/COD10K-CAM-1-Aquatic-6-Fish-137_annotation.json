  "background_description": "The background consists of a complex underwater rocky environment, covered with various shades of reddish-brown, dark brown, and greenish algae, interspersed with patches of greyish-white sand and granular rock. The texture is rough, irregular, and highly mottled, with numerous small crevices and shadowed areas.",

  "explanation": "The fish exhibits excellent camouflage. Its body coloration, a mix of reddish-browns, dark spots, and lighter flecks, precisely matches the dominant hues and granular appearance of the rocky seabed and the algae covering it. The irregular, bumpy, and spiny texture of the fish's skin and fins seamlessly integrates with the rough, textured surface of the rocks and detritus, making its outline extremely difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, the intricate patterns on its body disrupt its shape, preventing it from standing out as a distinct entity. There is very low contrast between the fish and its immediate surroundings, allowing it to blend almost perfectly."
