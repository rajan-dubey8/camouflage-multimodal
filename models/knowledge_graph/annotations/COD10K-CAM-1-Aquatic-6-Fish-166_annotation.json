  "background_description": "The background consists of an underwater rocky seabed, densely covered with various shades of dark green and brownish algae or plant growth. There are also lighter, almost white or pale yellow patches of bare rock, and darker crevices and shadowed areas providing a complex, mottled texture.",

  "explanation": "The fish exhibits excellent camouflage against its rocky, algae-covered underwater environment. Its body features a disruptive pattern of irregular dark greenish-brown blotches and lighter, almost white spots, which closely mimics the complex textures, colors, and light/shadow play of the background. The dark areas on the fish blend with the shadowed crevices and dense algae, while the lighter spots resemble the exposed rock or lighter algae patches. This high degree of color and pattern similarity effectively breaks up the fish's outline, making it very difficult to distinguish from the surrounding seabed."
