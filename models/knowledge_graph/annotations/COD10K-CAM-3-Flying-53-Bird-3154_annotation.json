  "explanation": "The peacock in this image is not camouflaged. Its vibrant, iridescent plumage, featuring brilliant blues on the head and neck, and iridescent green and blue on the body and long tail feathers with prominent 'eyespot' patterns, creates a stark visual contrast against the natural greens of the foliage and the brown of the soil. While some leaves partially obscure parts of its body, the striking colors and distinct feathery texture of the bird do not blend with the organic, leafy textures or the more muted green and brown tones of the environment. The high contrast and distinct patterns make the bird easily noticeable rather than hidden."
