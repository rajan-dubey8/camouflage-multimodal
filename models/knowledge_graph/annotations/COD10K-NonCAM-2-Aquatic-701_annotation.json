  "explanation": "The image clearly displays a Discus fish with distinct blue-gray fins and body, featuring a reddish-orange patch on its side. Its coloration and shape do not blend with the greenish water, aquatic plants, or dark wood/rock in the background, making it easily discernible. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
