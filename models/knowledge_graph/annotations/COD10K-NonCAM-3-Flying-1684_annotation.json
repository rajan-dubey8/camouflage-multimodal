  "explanation": "The Red-winged Blackbird is not camouflaged in this environment. Its prominent black plumage and bright red and yellow shoulder patches create a high contrast against the muted greens, browns, and blues of the marsh background and plant stems. These distinct markings are typically used for display and territorial signaling rather than for concealment, making the bird highly visible."
