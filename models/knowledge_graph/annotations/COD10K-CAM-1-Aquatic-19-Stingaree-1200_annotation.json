  "background_description": "The background consists of a clear, light blue-green ocean water column with scattered suspended particles, and a vast, pale sandy seafloor. The sand has subtle ripples and variations in texture, and in the immediate vicinity of the stingarees, there are clouds of disturbed sand.",

  "explanation": "The stingarees demonstrate excellent camouflage by actively burying themselves in the sand and stirring up sediment to cover their bodies. Their dorsal surfaces, when visible, are a dark shade, but they are almost entirely covered by the light-colored sand, making their visible parts (primarily eyes and outlines) blend remarkably well with the sandy seafloor. The disturbed sand around them further helps to obscure their shape and create a natural, low-contrast appearance against the environment. This combination of color blending, shape disruption through burial, and behavioral adaptation (sand-kicking) makes them extremely difficult to spot."
