  "explanation": "The lioness exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its tawny, yellowish-brown coat closely matches the dominant colors of the dry grass, earth, and light-colored rocks in the savannah environment. This color similarity allows the lioness to blend in with its surroundings, making it harder for prey to detect, especially from a distance or during low-light conditions. While its body shape is clearly discernible against the immediate foreground, the overall chromatic harmony significantly reduces its visibility within the wider landscape."
