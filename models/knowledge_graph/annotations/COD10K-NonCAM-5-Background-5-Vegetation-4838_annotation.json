  "background_description": "The scene depicts a coastal environment with numerous large, weathered tree trunks and branches scattered along a sandy beach and extending into the ocean. The logs vary in color from reddish-brown to dark grey, some with exposed roots. The ocean water is a turbulent light green-blue, with white breaking waves washing onto the light brown sandy shore. In the background, a dense treeline with both living green foliage and bare, gnarled branches can be seen. The sky above is bright blue with sparse white clouds.",
