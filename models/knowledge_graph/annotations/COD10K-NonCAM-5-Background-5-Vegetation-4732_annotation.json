  "background_description": "The scene depicts a large body of water (likely a lake or reservoir) surrounded by densely forested mountains under a heavily overcast, dark grey sky. The water surface is choppy and reflects the dim, diffused light. In the foreground, a wet, dark-colored concrete or tiled patio features several potted plants, including tall palms and smaller foliage, along with a dark plastic chair. A rustic wooden railing made of logs separates the patio from the water.",
