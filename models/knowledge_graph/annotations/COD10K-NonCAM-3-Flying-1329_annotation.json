  "explanation": "The image features a large flock of birds silhouetted against a bright sunset sky. The birds appear as dark, sharply defined shapes, creating a very high contrast against the luminous orange and yellow background. This strong contrast makes them highly visible and prominent, rather than camouflaged. There is no attempt at blending with the environment; instead, their dark forms stand out distinctly."
