  "background_description": "The image captures a dramatic sky with dark, heavy mammatus clouds, exhibiting a deep blue-purple hue and a distinctive bulbous, textured underside. These clouds dominate the upper left and central portions, gradually transitioning to a lighter grey-blue sky towards the right. Below the horizon, an urban landscape is visible, featuring various buildings, some with illuminated windows, suggesting dusk or nightfall. The immediate foreground appears to be an undeveloped or construction site with scattered debris and structures.",
