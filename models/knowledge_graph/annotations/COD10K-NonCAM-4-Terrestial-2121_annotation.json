  "explanation": "The lion and its cubs possess a tawny, sandy-brown coloration that naturally provides color blending camouflage. This coat color is highly effective in their typical savannah habitat, where it matches dry grasses, sandy terrain, and earthy tones. While they are somewhat distinguishable against the brighter green grass in the immediate foreground, their overall coloration aligns well with the drier, reddish-brown patches of earth and the general palette of an African landscape, making them less conspicuous in a broader sense within their natural environment. The large mane of the adult male also contributes to breaking up its outline, although the primary mechanism here is color matching."
