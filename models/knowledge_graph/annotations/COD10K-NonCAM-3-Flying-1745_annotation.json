  "explanation": "The Tricolored Heron in this image is highly visible and not camouflaged. Its prominent white belly and underwings create a strong contrast against the darker water and green reeds. Although the bird possesses countershading (darker upperparts, lighter underparts) which can serve as a form of camouflage, its dynamic pose with outstretched wings, coupled with the distinct color differences between its plumage (white, dark grey, reddish-brown) and the predominantly green and blue-green environment, makes it stand out rather than blend in. The small fish in its beak does appear to blend with the dark water/algae, but the main subject (the bird) is not camouflaged."
