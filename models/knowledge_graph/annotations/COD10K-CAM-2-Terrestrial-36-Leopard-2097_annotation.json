  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of thick, weathered tree trunks and branches, displaying various shades of brown, grey, and hints of green from moss or algae. Sparse green foliage is visible in the gaps between the woody structures, suggesting a forest or dense arboreal environment. The lighting is dappled, creating a mosaic of light and shadow across the surfaces, adding to the visual complexity.",

  "explanation": "The leopards exhibit highly effective camouflage in this arboreal environment. Their yellowish-tan base fur color closely blends with the lighter, sunlit areas of the tree bark, providing excellent color matching. The distinctive black rosette patterns on their fur serve as disruptive coloration, breaking up the animals' outlines and mimicking the irregular textures, shadows, and natural patterns found on the tree trunks and branches. This combination of color blending and pattern matching, further enhanced by the dappled lighting that creates a complex interplay of light and shadow, makes it very difficult to discern the distinct shape of the leopards against their busy, natural background."
