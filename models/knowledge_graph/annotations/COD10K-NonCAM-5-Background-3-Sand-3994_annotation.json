  "background_description": "The foreground displays light brown to tan colored sand, which is finely textured with subtle variations in shade and some scattered darker specks. In the midground, gentle turquoise-blue ocean waves meet the shore, creating a thin line of white foam as they break. The background is dominated by clear, calm turquoise-blue ocean water with soft surface ripples, reflecting the sunlight.",
