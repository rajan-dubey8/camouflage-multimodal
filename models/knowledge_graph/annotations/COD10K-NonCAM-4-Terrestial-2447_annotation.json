  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The red fox's reddish-brown fur exhibits color blending with elements of its natural habitat, particularly the dry, straw-like grass and fallen leaves in the background. While the fox stands out somewhat against the brighter green grass, its overall coloration helps it to be less conspicuous in a varied environment that includes dried vegetation and soil tones, typical of its species' natural camouflage strategy. The white underbelly and black markings on the legs and ears create some contrast, but the primary body color aids in blending."
