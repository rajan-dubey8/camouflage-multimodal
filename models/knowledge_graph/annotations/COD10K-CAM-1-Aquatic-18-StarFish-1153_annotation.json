  "explanation": "The StarFish itself is covered in sand, giving it a color and texture that closely matches the surrounding beach environment. This would typically contribute to excellent camouflage through color blending and texture matching. However, in this image, strong direct sunlight casts a very dark and clearly defined shadow directly beneath and to the right of the starfish. This prominent shadow creates a high contrast difference against the brighter sand, sharply outlining the starfish's distinct shape and making it stand out visually rather than blending into its environment. Therefore, despite its intrinsic material properties, the organism is not effectively camouflaged in this specific lighting condition."
