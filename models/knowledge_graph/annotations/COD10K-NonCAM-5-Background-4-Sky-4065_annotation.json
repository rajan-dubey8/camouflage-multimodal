  "background_description": "The image showcases a vast mountainous landscape under a bright blue sky. The foreground consists of dark, forested hills with visible green vegetation. As the landscape recedes into the mid-ground and background, the mountains appear progressively lighter in hue, transitioning from green to hazy blues and grays, indicative of atmospheric perspective. The sky features scattered white cumulus clouds, with some brighter, more defined clouds towards the top right, suggesting sunlight.",
