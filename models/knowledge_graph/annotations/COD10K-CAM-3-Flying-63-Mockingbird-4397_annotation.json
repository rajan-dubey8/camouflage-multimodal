  "explanation": "The mockingbird exhibits a degree of camouflage through color blending. Its gray plumage largely matches the varied gray tones of the rocky environment, allowing it to somewhat blend into the background. However, its smooth feathered texture contrasts with the rough, craggy rocks. Furthermore, the bird's distinct silhouette and the prominent white markings on its wings create noticeable contrast, preventing it from being perfectly hidden. While not strikingly out of place, it is still clearly visible against the environment."
