  "background_description": "The image features a vast expanse of dark, choppy ocean water under an overcast sky. A prominent, long, tubular roll cloud (arcus cloud) stretches horizontally across the middle of the frame, appearing as a dense, undulating white-grey band. Above this distinct cloud, the sky is filled with a mixture of dark grey and lighter grey storm clouds, creating a dramatic and moody atmosphere. The horizon line between the ocean and the sky is sharp.",
