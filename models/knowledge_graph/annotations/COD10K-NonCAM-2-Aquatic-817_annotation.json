  "explanation": "The fish's body exhibits a greenish-brown coloration that could offer some blending with a murky environment. However, its striking, vibrant red fins (caudal, anal, and dorsal fin tips) create a strong visual contrast against the muted, blurry background. These bright colors make the fish highly visible, rather than camouflaged. Therefore, camouflage is not present; instead, the coloration is likely for signaling or display."
