  "background_description": "The scene displays a vast coastal area at low tide under a bright blue sky with wispy clouds. The foreground features a rugged breakwater constructed from large, dark grey to greenish-brown rocks, some covered in moss or algae. Adjacent to the rocks is a light sandy beach, stretching into the distance. Patches of vibrant green seaweed or algae are visible on the wet sand. In the far distance, the ocean meets the horizon, with faint land formations or buildings visible.",
