  "background_description": "The background consists of a tree trunk with deeply fissured, rugged bark. The bark displays a mottled pattern of various shades of gray, dark brown, light brown, and some reddish-brown and pale, almost white or yellowish patches. The texture is rough and irregular, with prominent cracks, ridges, and flaking sections.",

  "explanation": "The cicada exhibits excellent camouflage against the tree bark. Its body and wings feature a complex, mottled pattern of grays, browns, and subtle yellowish-orange hues that perfectly match the varied coloration of the bark. The intricate textures of the cicada's exoskeleton and the venation of its wings closely mimic the rugged, fissured surface of the tree trunk. This combination of color blending and pattern matching effectively breaks up the cicada's outline and reduces its contrast with the background, making it very difficult to spot at first glance."
