  "background_description": "The moth is situated on the rough, textured, and mottled light brown bark of a tree trunk. The background behind the trunk consists of out-of-focus green foliage and a narrow strip of blue sky at the top left.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Pattern matching",
  "explanation": "The moth demonstrates excellent camouflage by perfectly blending with the tree bark. Its wings feature a complex pattern of light browns, beiges, and darker brown markings that closely mimic the colors and irregular textures of the bark. The intricate patterns on the wings effectively disrupt the moth's outline and create a visual continuity with the surrounding environment, making it very difficult to distinguish from the tree trunk. The low contrast difference between the moth's coloration and the bark further enhances its concealment."
