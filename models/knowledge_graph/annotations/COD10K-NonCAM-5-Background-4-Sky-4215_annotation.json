  "background_description": "The scene depicts a wide river under an overcast, grey sky. The foreground features a rocky riverbank composed of various sizes of grey and light brown stones. Several boats, mostly barges or ferries with blue, green, and some orange hull sections, are docked along the bank in the mid-ground. The river water is calm and reflects the muted tones of the sky. A distant landmass or forested bank is visible across the river on the horizon.",
