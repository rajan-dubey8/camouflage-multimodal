  "background_description": "The image displays a sky filled with various layers of clouds. Dark, heavy grey clouds dominate much of the frame, creating a somber atmosphere. On the left side, a bright, intense light source, presumably the sun, breaks through the cloud cover, casting a strong glare and illuminating the edges of nearby clouds with a yellowish-white glow. The clouds exhibit varied textures, from dense and opaque to lighter, more wispy formations. There's a subtle hint of iridescence or a rainbow-like effect within a lighter cloud area towards the center-right, suggesting atmospheric optical phenomena.",
