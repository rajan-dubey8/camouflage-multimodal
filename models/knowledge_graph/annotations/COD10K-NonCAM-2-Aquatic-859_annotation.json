  "explanation": "The goldfish exhibits vibrant orange/red, white, and silver coloration with some black spots. These bright colors create a strong contrast against the dark, muted blue and green background of its aquatic environment. Goldfish, especially ornamental varieties like this, are selectively bred for their striking appearance and are not naturally camouflaged for their surroundings. They stand out significantly, indicating an absence of camouflage."
