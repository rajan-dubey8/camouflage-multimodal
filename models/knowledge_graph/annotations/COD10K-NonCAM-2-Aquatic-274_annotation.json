  "explanation": "The image clearly displays a Grayling fish, identifiable by its elongated body, distinct black spots along its sides, and most notably, its large, colorful dorsal fin which is predominantly blue with dark patterns. Its vivid coloration and patterns, especially the dorsal fin, make it highly conspicuous against the darker, muted rocky background, confirming that no camouflage is present."
