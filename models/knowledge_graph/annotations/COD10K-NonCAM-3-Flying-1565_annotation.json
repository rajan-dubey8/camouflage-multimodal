  "explanation": "The image displays a large flock of birds flying against a bright blue sky. The birds appear as dark silhouettes, creating a high contrast against the light background. Their dark color and distinct shapes do not blend with the surrounding sky in terms of color or texture, making them highly visible rather than camouflaged. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning evident for camouflage."
