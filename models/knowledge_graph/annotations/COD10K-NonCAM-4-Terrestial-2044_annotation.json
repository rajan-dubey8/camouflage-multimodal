  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits natural camouflage through color blending. Its fur displays a blend of grey, brown, and reddish-brown tones, which closely mimic the typical colors found in its natural habitat, such as tree bark, branches, and leaf litter. While the squirrel is clearly visible due to the close-up nature of the photograph, its coloration is inherently designed to reduce its visibility against these natural backdrops, helping it evade predators and remain unnoticed by prey. The varied texture of its fur further aids in blending with the rough textures of its environment."
