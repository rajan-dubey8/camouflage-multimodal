  "explanation": "The giant anteater's dark brown and black fur, with a distinctive diagonal stripe, stands out starkly against the bright green grass of the environment. There is a high contrast in both color and brightness between the animal and its surroundings, and its shaggy texture does not blend with the fine blades of grass. Therefore, it is not camouflaged in this particular habitat."
