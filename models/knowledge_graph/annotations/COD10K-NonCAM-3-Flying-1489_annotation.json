  "object_name": "Small bird with bread",
  "background_description": "The bird is standing on a light greyish-blue, flat surface. The background behind the bird is heavily blurred with warm, out-of-focus lights or objects, presenting soft patches of yellow, orange, and red, along with some indistinct darker horizontal elements. The environment appears to be an urban or artificial setting, possibly indoors or a patio.",

  "camouflage_score": 0.0,

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bird's dark brown and black plumage with distinctive white markings on its wings stands out clearly against both the light greyish-blue surface it is perched on and the vibrant, blurred background. There is no color blending, texture matching, or disruptive patterning that would help the bird conceal itself in this environment. The contrast difference between the bird and its surroundings is high, making it highly visible."
