  "background_description": "The background consists of blurred forms of other impalas, and indistinct natural vegetation and dry earth, predominantly in shades of tan, brown, and muted green, characteristic of a savanna or grassland environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The impala exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-tan coat closely matches the dry grass and earthy tones of its savanna habitat. While the individual animal is clearly visible in this focused shot, its natural coloring helps it blend seamlessly into the environment, making it harder for predators to spot from a distance or in dappled light. The overall contrast difference between the impala and its natural background is low, further enhancing its ability to blend in."
