  "background_description": "The background consists of a weathered wooden bench or railing with a grey-green, possibly mossy, surface where the squirrel is sitting. Behind the bench, there is blurry green foliage (likely trees or bushes) and indistinct wooden structures, creating an outdoor, natural park-like or garden environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits passive camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-brown fur, dark tail, and greyish belly/face tones are naturally adapted to blend with the earthy colors of tree bark, soil, and wooden structures commonly found in its habitat. While the squirrel is sharply in focus and looking directly at the camera, making it easily detectable, its natural coloration provides a moderate degree of color similarity with the weathered wooden bench and the blurred brown and green tones of the background environment. The fluffy texture of its fur, however, is distinct from the smooth, worn texture of the bench, resulting in a lower texture similarity. The overall contrast difference is medium, meaning the squirrel is visible but its colors are not strikingly different from its surroundings, contributing to a lower-to-moderate camouflage score."
