  "explanation": "The silver dollar fish is brightly colored with reflective, silvery-yellow scales, making it highly conspicuous against the dark, textured background of submerged rocks and algae. Its smooth, shiny surface and light coloration create a strong contrast with the rough, dark, and uneven textures and colors of its immediate surroundings. While silvery scales can provide effective mirror-like camouflage in open, well-lit water by reflecting the ambient light, in this specific dark and cluttered environment, the fish is easily detectable and does not blend in."
