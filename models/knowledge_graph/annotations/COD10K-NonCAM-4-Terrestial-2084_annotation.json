  "explanation": "The lions' tawny and sandy fur color provides excellent color blending with the dry, yellowish-brown dirt and the light beige rocks in the background. This natural coloration is a classic example of camouflage, allowing them to blend into their typical savannah and rocky environments. While their distinct outlines are visible, their inherent color pattern significantly reduces their contrast against these natural elements, aiding in stealth for hunting or resting."
