  "explanation": "The spider exhibits strong camouflage against its gravelly background. Its body, particularly the abdomen and cephalothorax, displays a mottled brown and tan coloration with subtle darker stripes and patterns that closely mimic the varying shades and textures of the sand and small pebbles on the ground. The legs are also translucent and blend well with the light and shadow interplay of the surface. This high degree of color and pattern similarity, combined with low contrast against the environment, makes the spider difficult to spot, effectively disrupting its outline and allowing it to blend seamlessly."
