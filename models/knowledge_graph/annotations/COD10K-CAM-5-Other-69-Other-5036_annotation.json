  "explanation": "The red fox demonstrates effective camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-brown and tan fur closely matches the dominant color palette of the dry, withered grass in the field. The subtle variations in the fox's fur also align with the varied shades of the environment. By lying low to the ground, the fox further minimizes its silhouette and blends with the ground cover, making it difficult to discern from a distance, primarily due to its harmonious coloration with the surroundings."
