  "explanation": "The butterfly is primarily dark blue and black with iridescent qualities, standing out distinctly against the bright green leaves and lighter green flower clusters that form its background. There is a strong contrast in both color and luminance, making the butterfly highly visible rather than camouflaged. Its textures are also different from the surrounding plant elements."
