  "object_name": "Garnet Pitta",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a light brown, somewhat rough-textured log or branch. The background behind the bird is blurred, showing muted shades of brown, likely forest floor or other branches, interspersed with soft green elements, possibly fern fronds or other foliage.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bird exhibits exceptionally vibrant and contrasting plumage, featuring a deep blue/purple head with white speckles, a black face mask, a bright white throat, a vivid green back, and a warm orange-brown belly. This coloration stands out dramatically against the muted and natural tones of its forest habitat, which consists mainly of browns from wood and soil, and blurred greens from foliage. There is no attempt at color blending, disruptive patterning, or mimicry to conceal the bird; instead, its striking appearance is highly conspicuous, suggesting its colors are primarily for display or species recognition rather than camouflage."
