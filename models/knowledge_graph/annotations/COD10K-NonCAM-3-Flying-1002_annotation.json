  "explanation": "The flamingo's prominent light pink plumage, combined with its distinct black-tipped bill and yellow eye, creates a very high contrast against the dark green, blurred background. The colors and textures do not blend, and the animal is clearly visible and stands out significantly from its environment, indicating a complete absence of camouflage."
