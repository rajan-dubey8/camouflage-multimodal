  "background_description": "The scene presents a panoramic view of a coastal area under a clear blue sky. The upper portion shows a vast, light blue sky blending into the distant horizon over a calm, deep blue ocean. The middle ground features a dense, lush green forest covering rolling hills and landmasses, leading to a crescent-shaped sandy beach and a small, dark inland pond. The textures include the smooth surface of the ocean, the varied canopy of the forest with individual tree details, the fine grain of the sand, and the clear expanse of the sky.",
