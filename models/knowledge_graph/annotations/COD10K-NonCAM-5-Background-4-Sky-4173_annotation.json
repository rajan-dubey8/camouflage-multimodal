  "background_description": "The image features a serene mountainous landscape at dusk or dawn. The sky presents a beautiful gradient, transitioning from a deep indigo blue at the top to a lighter blue, then soft pinks and oranges near the horizon, indicative of sunrise or sunset. Silhouetted against this colorful sky are several dark mountains, with a dense line of trees in front of them, also appearing as dark forms. In the foreground, a body of water (likely a river or lake) reflects the sky's light, with some dark urban structures visible on the far right.",
