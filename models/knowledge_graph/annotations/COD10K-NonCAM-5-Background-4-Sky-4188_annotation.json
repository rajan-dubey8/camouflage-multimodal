  "background_description": "The scene depicts an urban setting during twilight, characterized by dark, muted tones. In the foreground and midground, there are multiple multi-story concrete buildings with visible windows, some appearing residential or institutional. A road with streetlights casts bright yellow-orange glows, illuminating parts of the ground and tree canopies. Distant mountains form dark silhouettes against the twilight sky, which transitions from a deep indigo blue at the top to a lighter, hazy grey-blue near the horizon where the last light of day fades.",
