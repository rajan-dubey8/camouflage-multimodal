  "object_name": "Pig swimming in turquoise water",
  "background_description": "The background features calm, clear turquoise-colored ocean water with gentle ripples in the foreground, transitioning to a light-colored sandy beach in the mid-ground. The sand has a fine texture with some darker specks.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The pig, with its distinct white/grey mottled skin and prominent pink snout, stands out sharply against the clear turquoise water and the light sandy beach. Its coloration and form do not blend with the aquatic or terrestrial background elements, resulting in a high contrast difference. There is no visible attempt at color blending, disruptive patterning, or mimicry of the environment, making the animal highly visible."
