  "background_description": "The image displays clear, shallow water with a vibrant turquoise-blue hue near the surface, transitioning to a more muted green over the seabed. Intense sunlight dapples the water's surface, creating intricate, shimmering patterns of bright light and shadows that extend to the visible bottom. The seafloor is composed of small, light-colored pebbles and coarse sand, showing varied textures and subtle color variations, from greyish-brown to hints of light ochre. The overall impression is one of transparency and dynamic light play.",
