  "explanation": "The toad exhibits excellent camouflage. Its skin coloration, a mottled mix of yellowish-tan, olive-brown, and reddish-brown bumps, closely matches the dried leaves, wood fragments, and earthy tones of its immediate environment. The warty, irregular texture of its skin further enhances this by mimicking the rough, broken surfaces of the debris. The irregular shape of the toad also helps to break up its outline against the similarly uneven background, reducing the contrast and making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding ground cover."
