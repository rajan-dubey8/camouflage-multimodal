  "object_name": "Katydid",
  "background_description": "The background consists of lush, vibrant green foliage, mostly out of focus, creating a soft, blurred environment. The immediate surroundings of the Katydid include a large, broad green leaf with prominent veins, on which it is resting, and other green leaves and stems both above and behind it, also primarily green and slightly blurred.",

  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Mimicry / Shape disruption",
  "explanation": "The Katydid exhibits exceptional camouflage. Its body and wings are a bright green, almost perfectly matching the color of the surrounding leaves. Crucially, the shape of its wings is strikingly similar to a leaf, complete with venation patterns that mimic those found on real leaves. This leaf-like morphology and coloration allow the Katydid to blend seamlessly with the dense green foliage, making it very difficult for predators to detect. The slight visible brown/white elements under its body are minor disruptions to an otherwise near-perfect disguise."
