  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The lion exhibits natural camouflage through color blending. Its tawny, golden-brown fur closely matches the colors of the dry grasses and earthy tones prevalent in its savanna habitat. While clearly visible in this frontal, well-lit shot, this coloration is a classic adaptation that allows lions to blend into their environment, aiding them in stalking prey or hiding. The similarity in color with the background vegetation helps to reduce its visibility, especially from a distance or during twilight hours."
