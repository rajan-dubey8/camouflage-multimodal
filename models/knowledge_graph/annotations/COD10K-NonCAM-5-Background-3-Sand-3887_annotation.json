  "object_name": "Rocky coastline at sunrise/sunset",
  "background_description": "The scene depicts a rugged rocky coastline during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, characterized by a soft gradient sky transitioning from a warm, pale orange near the horizon to a cool, light blue overhead. Large, dark, angular rocks, some covered in dark algae or seaweed, are scattered across the foreground and midground, partially submerged and surrounded by foamy, long-exposure blurred water. Waves gently crash and recede, creating a smooth, ethereal milky blue-white texture on the water and wet sand. The coastline extends into the distance with a steep, stratified rock face on the right, and a hazy, forested headland visible further along the coast.",
