  "explanation": "The ostrich's plumage, particularly the dusty brown and tan feathers visible on its head and neck, exhibits a high degree of color similarity with the plain, light orange-brown background. This effective color blending, combined with a low contrast difference, indicates camouflage. Ostriches naturally use their coloration to blend into the arid and semi-arid environments they inhabit, making it harder for predators to spot them against sandy or dry earth."
