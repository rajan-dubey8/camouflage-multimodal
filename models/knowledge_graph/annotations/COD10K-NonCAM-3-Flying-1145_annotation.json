  "object_category": "Insect",
  "object_name": "Bee",
  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of a dense cluster of small, vibrant yellow flowers, likely goldenrod, on which the bee is perched. Behind these flowers, the scene transitions to a soft, out-of-focus blur of dark greenish-blue, suggesting distant foliage or an obscured natural environment.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The bee's distinct black and golden-brown striped pattern and fuzzy texture stand out clearly against both the bright yellow flowers it is on and the blurred dark greenish-blue background. There is a high contrast difference, making the bee easily visible. Its coloration is more indicative of aposematism (warning coloration) rather than an attempt to blend into this particular environment for concealment."
