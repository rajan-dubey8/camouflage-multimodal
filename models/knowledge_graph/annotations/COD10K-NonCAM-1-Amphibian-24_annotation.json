  "explanation": "The image clearly displays a Cane Toad (Rhinella marina) resting on a concrete surface. Its natural earthy brown coloration and bumpy skin provide a medium natural resemblance to the rough texture and color of the concrete, but it is distinctly visible against both the concrete and the darker, out-of-focus background. No active camouflage behavior or patterns are observed, confirming the absence of camouflage."
