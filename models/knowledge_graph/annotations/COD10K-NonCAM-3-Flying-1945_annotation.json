  "explanation": "The insect, a beetle with a prominent black and orange/yellow patterned body, is highly visible against the white flowers and green background. Its coloration and distinct pattern create a high contrast, making it stand out rather than blend in. This suggests aposematic (warning) coloration instead of camouflage."
