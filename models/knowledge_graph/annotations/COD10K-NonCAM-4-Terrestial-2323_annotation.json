  "explanation": "The tree squirrel displays camouflage through color blending. Its fur, which features a combination of grey, brown, and subtle yellowish stripes, generally aligns with the earthy and muted tones of the tree bark it is perched on. This coloration helps to reduce its visibility against the natural background. While the squirrel's fluffy texture and distinct form are noticeable and different from the bark, its color palette helps it to somewhat blend in, making it less conspicuous to predators and prey in its arboreal habitat. The stripes also contribute to a degree of disruptive patterning, breaking up its outline, although color matching is the primary mechanism here."
