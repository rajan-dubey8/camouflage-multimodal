  "object_name": "Shallow water with sandy bottom",
  "background_description": "The image displays clear, shallow water over a sandy seabed. The water's surface shows ripples, causing intricate, wavy patterns of sunlight (caustics) to be projected onto the bottom. The sand varies in color from light beige to a slightly darker, greenish-brown hue with fine granular texture and some darker specks. The water itself appears greenish-blue, becoming lighter and more sky-blue towards the top where the surface reflects more light.",

  "explanation": "No organism, animal, insect, or fish is visible within the image. The scene exclusively depicts an aquatic environment with a clear, rippled water surface and a sandy bottom with light patterns from the sun. Therefore, no camouflage is present, as there is no subject to exhibit it."
