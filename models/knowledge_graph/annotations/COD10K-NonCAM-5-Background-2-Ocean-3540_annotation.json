  "background_description": "The image shows a vibrant ocean beach scene. The foreground features wet, light brown sand with foamy white waves receding and advancing. In the midground, a large wave is actively breaking, creating a splash of white foam and spray against the darker, turquoise-green ocean water. The water further out appears a deeper blue-green under direct sunlight.",
