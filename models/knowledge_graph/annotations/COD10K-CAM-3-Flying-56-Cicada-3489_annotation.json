  "background_description": "The cicada exuvia is attached to a thin, reddish-brown vine or stem. To the right, there is a prominent dark brown tree trunk with rough, textured bark. To the left and above, there are various green leaves, some appearing healthy, others showing signs of drying or discoloration (yellowish-brown). The background features a blurry bokeh effect of bright sky and distant green foliage.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The cicada exuvia exhibits a significant degree of camouflage primarily through color blending. Its dried, yellowish-brown to tan coloration closely matches the tones of the reddish-brown vine it is clinging to, as well as the various brown and dried-out textures of the nearby tree bark and discolored leaves. While the exuvia's segmented, chitinous texture is not a perfect match for the smooth vine, it aligns well with the general ruggedness of a woody environment or dry plant matter, reducing its visual distinctiveness. The overall contrast between the exuvia and its immediate surroundings (the vine and tree bark) is low, preventing it from standing out sharply. The exuvia's natural appearance as a shed skin inherently blends with the organic debris and textures typically found in a tree environment, making it difficult to spot at first glance."
