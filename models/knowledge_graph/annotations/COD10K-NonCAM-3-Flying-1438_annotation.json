  "object_name": "Crow",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a light blue metallic or plastic bar, which has white pipes and various colored electrical wires (blue, brown, black, white, pink) wrapped around it. In the blurry background, there are vibrant, out-of-focus shapes of orange, dark blue, green, and dark areas, suggesting a man-made structure like a boat or building.",

  "explanation": "The crow's dark grey and black plumage stands out significantly against the brightly colored artificial perch (light blue bar, white pipes, multi-colored wires) and the vibrant, albeit blurry, background elements (orange, blue, green). There is no color blending, disruptive patterning, or mimicry that would allow the bird to conceal itself in this environment. Its form and color are highly conspicuous."
