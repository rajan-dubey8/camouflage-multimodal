  "explanation": "The Cicada exhibits excellent camouflage against the tree bark. Its body coloration, a mix of mottled grays, browns, and subtle olive tones, very closely matches the color palette of the bark. The texture of its exoskeleton, particularly on the head and thorax, is rough and irregular, mimicking the rugged surface of the bark. Furthermore, the complex patterns and markings on the Cicada's body, along with the venation on its wings, break up its outline and blend seamlessly with the varied cracks, ridges, and specks of the background. This combination of color blending, pattern matching, and shape disruption results in very low contrast between the organism and its environment, making it incredibly difficult to spot."
