  "background_description": "The cat is resting on a series of light brown/tan stone steps or ledges, which feature visible veining and grout lines indicative of natural stone tiles. Behind the cat, there is a building wall with sections of light-colored, horizontally stacked stone blocks and a plainer, light brown/tan panel. A grey metal accordion-style security gate is positioned in front of the upper part of the wall. To the cat's immediate left, there is a step or platform made of light-colored, possibly rusty, diamond-plate metal.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The cat demonstrates a good degree of camouflage, primarily due to excellent color blending. Its light tan/gingery fur closely matches the warm, earthy tones of the stone steps and wall, creating a low color contrast with its immediate surroundings. This makes the cat less conspicuous at a glance. However, the camouflage is not perfect as its smooth fur texture contrasts with the rough, veined stone and the distinct patterns of the diamond-plate metal. Additionally, while the color blends well, the cat's distinct, rounded shape is still discernible, preventing full visual disappearance."
