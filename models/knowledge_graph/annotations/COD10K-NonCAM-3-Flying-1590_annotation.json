  "explanation": "The Southern Ground-Hornbill in the image exhibits prominent black plumage and striking bright red/orange skin around its eyes and throat, which strongly contrasts with the blurred, light brown, earthy background and the dark log it is perched upon. Its dark body stands out against the lighter environment, and its vibrant facial coloration makes it highly conspicuous. There are no patterns or coloration that blend with the surroundings in terms of color, texture, or disruptive patterns, indicating a complete absence of camouflage."
