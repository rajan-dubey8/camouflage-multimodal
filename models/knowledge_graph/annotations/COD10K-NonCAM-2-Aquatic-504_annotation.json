  "explanation": "Two dead fish are clearly visible in a white colander against a kitchen counter background. The prominent red fish is identifiable as a Red Snapper. There is no camouflage present, as the fish are out of their natural habitat and stand out distinctly against the man-made kitchen items. The background description refers to the natural aquatic habitat of a Red Snapper, not the non-aquatic environment shown in the image."
