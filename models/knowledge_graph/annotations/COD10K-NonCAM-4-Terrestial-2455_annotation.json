  "explanation": "The Pufferfish exhibits natural camouflage characteristics, specifically a disruptive pattern. Its body is covered in a mottled grey-brown coloration with numerous dark, almost black, spots and small bumps/spines. This pattern is designed to break up its outline and blend with varied textures of coral reefs, rocky seabeds, or sandy bottoms where it typically resides. While the fish is clearly visible in this image due to the clear water and direct lighting, its inherent coloration and pattern serve as a form of camouflage. The contrast with the uniform blueish background in this specific shot highlights the fish rather than hiding it, hence the medium camouflage score, but the features themselves are camouflaging."
