  "explanation": "The image features a bumblebee prominently displayed on a pink clover flower. The bumblebee's distinct coloration, consisting of black and vibrant yellow-orange fur, creates a high contrast against both the pink petals of the flower and the blurred green background. Its fuzzy texture also clearly differentiates it from the smoother surfaces of the flower and the indistinct background. Bumblebees are not typically camouflaged; their bright patterns often serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) rather than for blending in. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
