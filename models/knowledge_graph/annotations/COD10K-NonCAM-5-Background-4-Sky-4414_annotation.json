  "background_description": "The image displays an overcast sky dominated by shades of dark blue-grey clouds. The clouds have varied densities and textures, ranging from smooth, uniform areas to more turbulent, lumpy formations. Lighter, almost white, patches are visible, particularly towards the bottom and in areas where light penetrates through the cloud cover, suggesting either a break in the clouds or the beginning of a sunset/sunrise.",
