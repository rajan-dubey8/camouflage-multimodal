  "explanation": "The grasshopper, being a vibrant lime green, stands out significantly against the bright yellow flowers it is perched upon. While green coloration generally helps grasshoppers blend with green foliage, in this specific context, the striking color contrast between its body and the yellow plant makes it highly conspicuous. Additionally, the strong backlighting highlights its silhouette and edges, further reducing any potential for concealment. There is also no textural similarity between the grasshopper's smooth body and the granular texture of the flowers."
