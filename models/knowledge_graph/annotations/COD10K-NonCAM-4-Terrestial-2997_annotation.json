  "explanation": "The moose's dark brown fur contrasts significantly with the predominantly bright green and yellowish-brown grassy background. While a moose's coloration might offer some blending in a dense, dark forest or against soil and tree bark, in this bright, open grassy field, its large, dark form stands out. There is low similarity in both color and texture between the animal and its immediate surroundings, resulting in a high contrast difference."
