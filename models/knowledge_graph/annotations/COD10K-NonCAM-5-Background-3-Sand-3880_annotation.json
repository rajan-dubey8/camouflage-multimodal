  "background_description": "The image depicts a broad, dry coastal landscape under a bright blue sky dotted with scattered white cumulus clouds. The foreground consists of a mixture of light brown sand, small grey pebbles, and numerous light-colored, irregular rocks and boulders. Patches of lighter, almost white, dried-out sediment are visible across the ground. Towards the left, rolling hills covered with sparse, dry green and brown vegetation rise, transitioning into lighter, eroded slopes. In the middle ground, the terrain is rocky and extends towards a body of water, likely an ocean, which exhibits a turquoise hue closer to the shore. Distant, hazy blue mountains line the horizon beyond the water.",
