  "explanation": "The toad exhibits excellent camouflage through pattern matching and color blending. Its skin features a mottled pattern of dark greens, browns, and lighter creamy-white spots which closely mimic the textures and colors of the surrounding environment, specifically the green grass, brown soil, and varying light conditions. The irregular bumpy texture of its skin further helps it blend with the uneven ground and plant debris. This disruptive coloration effectively breaks up the toad's outline, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The overall contrast between the toad and its surroundings is low, preventing it from standing out."
