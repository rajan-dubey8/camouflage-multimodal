  "explanation": "The American Robin is clearly visible in the image. Its vibrant orange breast provides a strong contrast against the dark brown soil, pebbles, and green moss of the background. While its grey back feathers share some muted tones with the environment, the prominent orange color ensures it stands out and is not camouflaged. There is no attempt at color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterning to conceal the bird."
