  "explanation": "The butterfly demonstrates excellent camouflage through color blending with its environment. Its wings and body are primarily a bright yellow-green, which remarkably matches the dominant yellow of the surrounding flowers and blends well with the green foliage. This high color similarity and low contrast difference make the butterfly blend seamlessly into the floral background, making it challenging to spot at a glance. The small dark spots on its wings are minor details that do not significantly disrupt the overall color match."
