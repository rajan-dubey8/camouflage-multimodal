  "explanation": "The Northern Cardinal's striking, vibrant red plumage creates a very high contrast with its environment, which is dominated by dull grey, white, and brown tones of bare branches and a snowy background. Its bright color makes it highly conspicuous rather than allowing it to blend in, indicating a complete absence of camouflage. This coloration is typically used for species recognition and attracting mates, especially for the male cardinal depicted."
