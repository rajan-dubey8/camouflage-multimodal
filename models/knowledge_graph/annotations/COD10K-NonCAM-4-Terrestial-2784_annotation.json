  "object_name": "Goat",
  "background_description": "The background consists of out-of-focus green foliage, appearing as a blurred mass of varying shades of dark green, suggesting dense leaves and trees. The texture is soft and indistinct due to the shallow depth of field.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The goat's light tan and off-white fur color stands out distinctly against the dark green, blurred foliage of the background. There is a clear difference in both hue and luminance, creating a high contrast that makes the goat easily visible. The textured fur also differs significantly from the smooth, out-of-focus background, indicating no effective camouflage strategy is in use."
