  "explanation": "The cheetahs exhibit effective camouflage through both color blending and disruptive patterns. Their golden-tan fur provides high color similarity with the dry savanna grass and earth tones of the environment. Additionally, the distinctive black spots act as a disruptive pattern, breaking up the animals' outlines. This makes it difficult for observers to discern their forms against the varied textures and dappled light/shadow effects of the patchy background, significantly reducing their visibility to prey or other animals."
