  "explanation": "The lioness possesses a tawny or sandy-colored coat, which is a form of color blending camouflage naturally adapted for dry grassland and savanna environments. However, in this specific image, the immediate background comprises dark green foliage and dark brown/black logs/rocks. The light color of the lioness contrasts sharply with these dark background elements, making it highly visible. Neither the color nor the texture of the lioness blends effectively with its immediate surroundings in this particular scene, thus rendering its inherent camouflage ineffective for detection in this context."
