  "explanation": "The Yellow Tang fish is a vibrant, uniform bright yellow, which creates a high contrast against the deep blue water and the muted, earthy tones of the rocky and coralline reef background. There is no blending in color or texture with its surroundings. The fish is designed to stand out rather than blend in, thus showing no signs of camouflage."
