  "explanation": "The elephant is a large mammal whose primary defense strategy is not camouflage. Its dark grey, wrinkled skin color stands out significantly against the lighter, pale green and yellowish tall grass and the green foliage of the trees and bushes in the background. The elephant's immense size makes it highly conspicuous and creates a strong contrast with its surroundings, indicating no attempt at or presence of camouflage."
