The foreground features a sandy beach area illuminated by an artificial light source, casting long, intricate shadows of palm fronds onto the sand. A paved walkway with a drainage grate and a prominent orange and white traffic cone are visible in the lower left. Beyond the sandy area, there is a dark expanse of ocean with numerous faint, scattered lights in the distance, likely from boats or a distant shore. The background also includes the dark silhouettes of several palm trees and other dense foliage against a dark night sky.",
