  "explanation": "The fish, identified as a juvenile Harlequin Sweetlips, exhibits striking bright yellow coloration with bold black vertical stripes and vibrant blue fins. These vivid and contrasting colors, along with the distinct striped pattern, make the fish highly conspicuous against the muted greens, browns, and organic textures of the surrounding coral reef environment. There is no visible attempt at color blending, disruptive patterning, or mimicry to help it conceal itself. Instead, its prominent appearance suggests a lack of camouflage, possibly indicating aposematic (warning) coloration or simply a species that does not rely on camouflage for survival at this life stage."
