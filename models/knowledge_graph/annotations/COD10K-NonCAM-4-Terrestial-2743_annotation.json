  "explanation": "The wild rabbit exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its fur is a mottled mix of browns, grays, and reddish-browns, which closely matches the colors of the dry soil, dead leaves, and sparse vegetation in its immediate environment. The texture of its fur also blends well with the granular and irregular textures of the ground. While the rabbit is clearly visible in this well-lit photo, its natural coloration significantly reduces its contrast against the typical woodland or garden floor, making it harder to spot by predators in its natural habitat. The white tail is a notable exception but is usually tucked or used as a warning signal when fleeing."
