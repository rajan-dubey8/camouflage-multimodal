  "object_name": "Two kittens",
  "background_description": "The kittens are situated on a pathway constructed from light grey, irregularly shaped stone pavers. Sparse patches of green and dried brown grass grow in the gaps between the stones. The background beyond the immediate vicinity is softly out of focus, showing more of the same stone path and grass.",

  "explanation": "The two kittens, one a brown-grey tabby and the other a calico-tabby with white, black, and orange/brown patches, are clearly visible against the light grey stone path and sparse grass. Their fur patterns and colors do not effectively blend them into this specific environment. The contrast between their fur (especially the white patches of the right kitten) and the background is high, making them easily detectable and not camouflaged."
