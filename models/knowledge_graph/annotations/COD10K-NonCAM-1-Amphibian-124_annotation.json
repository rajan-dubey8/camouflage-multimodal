  "explanation": "The frog exhibits strong camouflage through a combination of color blending and disruptive patterning. Its skin features a mottled mix of olive greens, browns, and dark blotches, which closely match the colors of the muddy ground and the surrounding green grass. The irregular dark blotches on its back and legs serve as a disruptive pattern, breaking up the frog's silhouette and making it difficult for predators to distinguish its form from the textured, varied background of mud, shadows, and plant matter. The texture of its skin also somewhat mimics the uneven surface of the wet mud, further aiding its concealment."
