  "explanation": "The toad exhibits strong camouflage against the rock face. Its mottled light brown and tan coloration with darker spots closely matches the various shades of the weathered rock, including lighter sandy patches and reddish mineral streaks, indicating high color similarity. The bumpy, granular texture of its skin also highly resembles the rough and irregular surface of the rock, contributing to excellent pattern matching. Furthermore, the toad is strategically positioned within a crevice, utilizing the natural shadows and irregular contours of the rock to disrupt its shape and blend seamlessly into the environment. While its form is discernible upon closer inspection, the overall contrast is significantly reduced, making it difficult to spot at first glance."
