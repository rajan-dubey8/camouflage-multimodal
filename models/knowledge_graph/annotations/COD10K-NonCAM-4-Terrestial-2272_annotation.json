  "explanation": "The giraffe displays a classic disruptive pattern camouflage with its irregular dark brown patches against a lighter tan and cream base. While the immediate background in this image is uniformly blurred and light, giraffes naturally use this patterning to break up their large outline. In their native savanna habitat, these patterns blend with the dappled light and shadows cast by trees and vegetation, making it difficult for predators to discern the animal's true form, especially from a distance. The variation in color and shape prevents the eye from perceiving a continuous shape. The dark patches contrast significantly with the lighter fur and the background, contributing to the disruptive effect."
