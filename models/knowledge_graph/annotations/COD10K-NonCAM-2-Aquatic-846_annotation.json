  "explanation": "The Peacock Bass exhibits strong camouflage primarily through a disruptive pattern. Its body is marked with irregular dark bands and blotches over a base of yellowish-green. These patterns, combined with the fish's overall coloration, blend effectively with the varied textures, light, and shadows found in its natural freshwater habitat, which typically includes submerged vegetation, roots, and mottled substrates. The dark markings help to break up the fish's outline against the darker elements and shadows in the background, while the yellow-green tones match the lighter areas and aquatic plants. This combination makes it difficult for predators or prey to discern the fish's true shape and location."
