  "explanation": "The sparrow's grey and brown plumage offers no color blending or textural similarity with the vibrant blue sky or the rusty red metal fence it is perched upon. Its distinct shape and coloration stand out clearly against both elements of the background, making it highly visible and indicating no camouflage is present."
