  "explanation": "The main subject is a white egret standing in a body of water, holding a fish. The bird's pristine white plumage creates a stark visual contrast against the dark blue water and the vibrant green lotus leaves. There is no color blending, disruptive patterning, or mimicry that would help the egret blend into this environment. In fact, its bright white color makes it highly conspicuous, indicating the absence of camouflage."
