The foreground water is deep blue-green with distinct ripples and small waves. Further towards the horizon, the water's color becomes lighter and more subdued, reflecting the sky. On the left, a lush green coastline with dense trees and foliage is visible. The sky transitions from a soft turquoise blue at the top to warm pink and orange hues near the horizon, with delicate, wispy clouds scattered across it.",
