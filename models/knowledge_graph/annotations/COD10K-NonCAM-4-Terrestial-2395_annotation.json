  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits camouflage primarily through color blending. Its fur, a mix of brown and grey tones, closely matches the color of the weathered fallen log it is resting upon. This provides high color similarity between the organism and its immediate perch. While the texture of its fur is different from the rough bark of the log, the overall tonal match minimizes contrast, making the squirrel less conspicuous against its natural environment. The surrounding green grass, though a different color, is somewhat blurred, and the squirrel's muted tones help it blend with the earthy elements rather than sharply standing out."
