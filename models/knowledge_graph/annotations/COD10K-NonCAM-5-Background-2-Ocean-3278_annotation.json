  "background_description": "The image features a serene coastal scene under a bright, partly cloudy sky. The sky is a light blue with streaks of white cirrus clouds and faint contrails. On the left, a rocky shoreline rises, composed of dark grey and brown rock formations, topped with dry, yellowish-brown grass and a small, green-leafed deciduous tree. In the foreground and stretching into the mid-ground, a calm body of water (likely a fjord or bay) reflects the sky, showing ripples and patches of dark brown-green seaweed or aquatic vegetation floating on its surface. In the distance, low-lying hills covered in dark green foliage extend along the horizon.",
