  "object_name": "Red Avadavat (Strawberry Finch)",

  "explanation": "The bird's plumage, featuring prominent bright red areas (beak, eye-ring, lower back/tail), distinct white spots on dark wings, and a brownish-grey body, stands out significantly against the uniformly blurred green background. There is no attempt at color matching or disruptive patterning to blend with the environment, making the bird highly visible. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
