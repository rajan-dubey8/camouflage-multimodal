  "object_name": "SeaHorse",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a dark, murky greenish-blue open water, with the immediate environment being a complex, highly textured, reddish-brown marine growth, possibly coral or algae, covered in small detritus or other epibionts. This growth has an irregular, somewhat branching structure.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Pattern matching",
  "explanation": "The SeaHorse exhibits excellent camouflage by perfectly matching the color and texture of the marine growth it is clinging to. Its reddish-brown body with subtle yellow speckles seamlessly blends with the irregular, detritus-covered surface of the background object. The bumpy, somewhat spiky texture of the seahorse's skin also mirrors the rough and varied texture of the growth, further enhancing the blend. The overall contrast between the organism and its immediate environment is very low, making it difficult to distinguish the seahorse's outline from the background structure."
