  "object_name": "Winter park scene with miniature golf sign",
  "background_description": "The scene depicts a winter landscape covered in snow. Numerous bare deciduous trees with dark, gnarled trunks and branches are prominent, some with patches of snow clinging to their limbs. In the mid-ground, a white sign for 'River View Miniature Golf' stands on a snow-covered pole. Beyond the sign and trees, a body of water (likely a river or pond) is visible, and a brown wooden structure with multiple levels and railings is situated near the water's edge, possibly part of the miniature golf course or another facility. The sky is overcast and grey, contributing to the overall muted winter palette.",
