  "explanation": "The snow monkey's fur is light brown-grey, but its bright red face creates a very high contrast against its own fur and the muted tones of the wet rocks and water in the background. The monkey's distinct form and coloration make it stand out clearly, indicating no presence of camouflage for concealment within this environment."
