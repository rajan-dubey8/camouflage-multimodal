  "background_description": "The scene features a vast expanse of light gray and white mist or overcast sky dominating the upper half. Below, lush mountain slopes covered in dense, varied green foliage recede into the distance, appearing muted green to bluish-green due to the atmospheric haze. In the foreground, vibrant green trees with distinct leaf textures are visible on the left, while on the right, dark, bare tree branches with intricate, angular patterns frame the scene. A small, traditional Chinese-style pavilion with a dark, possibly weathered and textured roof is nestled amongst the trees in the lower-right mid-ground.",
