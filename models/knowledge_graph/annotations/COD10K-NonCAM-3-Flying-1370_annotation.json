  "explanation": "The Roseate Spoonbill's vibrant pink plumage and distinct white head and neck create a strong visual contrast against the dark green water and vegetation of its habitat. Its bright coloration and unique shape make it highly conspicuous rather than allowing it to blend into the environment. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
