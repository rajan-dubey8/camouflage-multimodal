  "background_description": "The image displays an expanse of sand with distinct wave-like ripples. The sand exhibits alternating bands of light golden-tan and darker greyish-blue tones, likely due to variations in sand composition, moisture, or lighting and shadows created by the undulating surface. The texture is granular, typical of sand, with clear, defined patterns formed by wind or water.",
