  "background_description": "The scene depicts a wide expanse of ocean under a dramatic cloudy sky. The sky is predominantly covered by dark, grey stratus clouds with bright patches where sunlight is piercing through, particularly in the upper left. Near the horizon, there's a band of warmer, lighter clouds with hints of orange and yellow, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The ocean surface is dark blue-grey, appearing calm with subtle ripples, and reflects a vertical path of light from the sky.",
