  "object_name": "Ocean surface with sun glare",
  "background_description": "The image displays a vast expanse of ocean under what appears to be an overcast or hazy sky. The water surface is dominated by intense sun glare, creating numerous bright, shimmering reflections that scatter across the mid-ground and background. Closer to the foreground, darker, greenish-gray water is visible with small, breaking waves, some showing foamy white crests. The overall texture is dynamic and fluid, with a strong contrast between the brilliant reflections and the darker water.",
