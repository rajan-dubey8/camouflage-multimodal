  "explanation": "The squirrel exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its fur, which is a mix of grey and light brown, closely matches the dominant greyish-brown tones of the tree bark it is resting on. This strong color similarity, combined with the slightly varied texture of its fur, helps to reduce its contrast and silhouette against the tree, making it less conspicuous to predators and prey in its natural habitat."
