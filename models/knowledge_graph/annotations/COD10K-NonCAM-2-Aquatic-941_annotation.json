  "explanation": "The koi fish in the image display vibrant orange and white coloration, which contrasts sharply with the dark, almost black water background. These ornamental fish are selectively bred for their striking visual appearance, making them highly conspicuous rather than camouflaged. Their bright patterns and distinct forms stand out significantly, indicating a complete absence of camouflage in this environment."
