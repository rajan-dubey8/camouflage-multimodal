  "explanation": "The sparrow displays effective camouflage through color blending. Its plumage, consisting of various shades of brown, grey, and off-white, closely matches the light brown and off-white hues of the weathered rocks it is standing on. This high color similarity allows the bird to blend seamlessly with its immediate surroundings, making it less conspicuous to predators or prey. While its texture is softer than the rough rock, and there is some medium contrast difference due to light and shadow emphasizing its shape, the overall effect is a significant reduction in visual detectability."
