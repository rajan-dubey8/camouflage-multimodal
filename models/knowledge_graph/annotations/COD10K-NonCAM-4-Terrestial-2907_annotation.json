  "explanation": "The bison, a large mammal with dark brown to almost black shaggy fur, stands out prominently against the lighter, grayish-green and dry brown hues of the sagebrush and grasses in its environment. Its massive size, distinct dark coloration, and overall silhouette create a high contrast with the background, making it easily visible. There is no significant blending of colors or patterns, nor does it mimic any specific environmental feature. Therefore, it does not exhibit camouflage in this scene."
