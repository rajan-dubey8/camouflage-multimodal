  "explanation": "The brown bear's fur color, a mix of medium and darker browns, contrasts sharply with the vibrant green of the grassy background. While brown fur can offer camouflage in forest environments, rocky terrains, or dry fields, it stands out clearly against the lush green vegetation seen in this image. There is a strong visual difference in both color and texture between the bear and its immediate surroundings, making it highly visible."
