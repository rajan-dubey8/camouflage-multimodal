  "explanation": "The Mandarin duck displays extremely vibrant and diverse plumage, featuring striking colors such as bright orange, red, green, purple, yellow, white, and black. These vivid patterns and colors stand in stark contrast to the plain, light, and blurry background. Mandarin ducks are known for their ornamental appearance, primarily for sexual display, rather than for blending into their environment for concealment. There is no visual attempt at camouflage; instead, the bird's features are highly conspicuous."
