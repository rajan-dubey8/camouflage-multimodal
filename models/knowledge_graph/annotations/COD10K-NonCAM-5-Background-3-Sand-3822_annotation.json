  "background_description": "The image features a dynamic coastal scene. On the right, a large, steep rocky cliff with reddish-brown and grey-toned granite formations dominates, showing clear fracture lines and a rugged texture. Sparse dark green trees and vegetation grow on the top and in crevices of the cliff. The base of the cliff meets turbulent dark teal to blue-green ocean water, characterized by white foamy waves crashing forcefully against the rocks and shoreline. In the distance to the left, a forested island or headland is visible under a bright blue sky with scattered white cumulus clouds.",
