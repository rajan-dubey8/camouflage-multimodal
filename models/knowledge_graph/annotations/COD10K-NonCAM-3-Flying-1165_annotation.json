  "object_category": "Bird",
  "object_name": "Chaffinch",
  "background_description": "The bird is perched on a weathered, light-colored wooden plank, likely part of a deck or railing. The background is a soft-focus natural landscape featuring green foliage, a body of water, distant mountains (some snow-capped), and a blue sky with scattered white clouds.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The Chaffinch exhibits bright and distinct plumage, particularly its orange-peach breast, grey head, and prominent black and white markings on its wings. These colors and patterns create a strong contrast against both the light wooden surface it is perched on and the blurred natural background, making the bird highly visible. There is no visual evidence of color blending, mimicry, or disruptive patterns to conceal its presence in this environment."
