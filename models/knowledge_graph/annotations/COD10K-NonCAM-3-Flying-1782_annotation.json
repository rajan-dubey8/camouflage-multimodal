  "explanation": "The Common Pierrot butterfly, with its distinctive black and white striped pattern on the wings and a prominent reddish-orange patch on its body, creates a high contrast against the predominantly soft, blurred yellowish-green background foliage. There is no attempt at color matching or disruptive patterning to blend with the environment; instead, the butterfly's patterns and colors make it clearly visible and stand out. Therefore, camouflage is not present in this scene."
