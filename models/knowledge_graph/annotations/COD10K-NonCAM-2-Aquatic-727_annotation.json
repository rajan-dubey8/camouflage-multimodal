  "explanation": "The image clearly shows a large, dead fish (likely a Cod or similar species) with its mouth agape, resting on a bed of crushed ice. This is an artificial setting, not a natural aquatic environment, and the fish's coloration and texture are in high contrast to the white ice and surrounding market items. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
