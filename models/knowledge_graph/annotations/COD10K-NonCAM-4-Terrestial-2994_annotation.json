  "explanation": "The fennec fox's light, sandy-colored fur contrasts sharply with the dark, blurred background in this image. There is a significant difference in both color and brightness, making the animal highly visible and not blended into its immediate surroundings. While fennec foxes are known for their natural camouflage in sandy desert environments, the specific background in this photograph does not match, thus negating any effective camouflage."
