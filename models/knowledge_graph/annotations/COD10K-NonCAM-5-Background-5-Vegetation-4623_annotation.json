In the midground, there are expansive, lighter green fields, likely cultivated rice paddies, interspersed with clusters of trees and a small body of water reflecting the sky. Rolling hills and mountains, densely covered in trees and vegetation, form the background, fading slightly into a hazy, light blue sky at the top. The overall color palette is dominated by greens, with variations in texture from smooth fields to the rougher canopy of trees.",
