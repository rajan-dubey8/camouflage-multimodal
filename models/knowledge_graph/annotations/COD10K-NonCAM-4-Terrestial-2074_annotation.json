  "explanation": "The tigers exhibit disruptive pattern camouflage through their distinct black stripes on an orange-brown coat. This pattern is naturally evolved to break up their silhouette and blend into environments like tall grasses and dappled light of forests. While they are clearly visible in this specific image against the dark green foliage and dark wooden platform, their stripes still function as a camouflage mechanism. The orange-brown fur provides some color blending with earthy tones, and the stripes, despite the contrast, aim to disrupt the body outline. In a more ideal natural setting, this pattern would make them very difficult to spot. In this image, the contrast against the dark green foliage is moderate, but the inherent camouflage pattern is undeniable."
