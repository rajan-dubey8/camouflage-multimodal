  "contrast_difference": "high",
  "camouflage_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The blackbird's dark brown/black plumage creates a stark contrast against the uniformly bright white background. This high contrast makes the bird highly visible and conspicuous, rather than camouflaged. There is no evidence of color blending, disruptive patterns, or mimicry with its immediate surroundings."
