  "explanation": "The Warthog exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its dull, grayish-brown skin and sparse, coarse hair closely match the muted earthy tones of the dry ground and the subdued green vegetation in the background. This high color similarity and low contrast difference make the animal blend seamlessly with its natural habitat of savanna and bushland, reducing its visibility to predators. While the specific texture of its hair isn't a perfect match for the blurred background, its overall rough, mottled appearance contributes to breaking up its outline against a natural, uneven terrain."
