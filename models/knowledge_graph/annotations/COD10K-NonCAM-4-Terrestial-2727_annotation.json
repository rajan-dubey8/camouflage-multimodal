  "explanation": "The red squirrel's distinct reddish-brown fur and contrasting white belly create a high visual difference against the vibrant light green moss and the blurred bright green background. While squirrels generally use color blending to match tree bark or dried leaves in their natural habitat, in this specific scene, its coloration and shape stand out prominently, making it easily detectable. Therefore, effective camouflage is not present in this image."
