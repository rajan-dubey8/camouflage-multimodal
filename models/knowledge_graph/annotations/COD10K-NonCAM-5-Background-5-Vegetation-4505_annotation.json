  "background_description": "The image displays a dense tropical jungle or forest. The background is characterized by a thick canopy of various trees, many of which are covered in vines and lush green foliage. Colors range from deep, dark greens to lighter, vibrant greens. A prominent feature is a tree with bright purple flowers in the middle-left, and hints of orange-red foliage are visible on the far left. The textures are primarily organic, consisting of numerous leaves, smooth tree trunks, and the rough, weathered appearance of a dead tree stump on the right. The sky overhead is bright white, indicating an overcast day or high exposure.",
