  "camouflage_type": "Color blending",
  "explanation": "The mouse exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its grayish-brown fur closely matches the color palette of the surrounding soil and dry leaves, making it difficult to distinguish from the background. The low contrast between the mouse's body and the ground further enhances its concealment, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its natural environment."
