  "explanation": "The Impala exhibits effective color blending camouflage. Its reddish-brown to tan coat color closely matches the dominant dry and golden-green hues of the savanna grass environment. This natural coloration helps the animal blend into its surroundings, making it harder for predators to spot. While the horns provide some contrast, the body's overall coloration significantly reduces its visibility against the grassy background, particularly when stationary or moving slowly."
