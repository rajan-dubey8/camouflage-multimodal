  "explanation": "The image clearly displays a Foxface Rabbitfish (Siganus vulpinus) with bright yellow fins, light brown body, and prominent dark stripes, being cleaned by a distinct blue and black Bluestreak Cleaner Wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). Both fish exhibit vibrant coloration that contrasts sharply with the dark blue-green open water background, confirming the absence of any camouflage."
