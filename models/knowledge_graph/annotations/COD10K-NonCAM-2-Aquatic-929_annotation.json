  "explanation": "The Longhorn Cowfish is vibrantly yellow with distinct light blue spots, making it highly conspicuous against the dark and muted background of the aquarium. Its bright coloration and unique, angular body shape cause it to stand out significantly, indicating a complete absence of camouflage. This species is often thought to rely on its striking appearance and potentially toxic mucus as a defense mechanism rather than concealment through camouflage."
