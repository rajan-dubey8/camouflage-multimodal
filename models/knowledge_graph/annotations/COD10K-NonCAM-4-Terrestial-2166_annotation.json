  "explanation": "The Ring-tailed Lemurs exhibit distinct grey, brown, and white fur with prominent black and white striped tails and distinct facial markings. These colors and patterns do not blend with the green grassy background. Their coloration provides high contrast against the environment, making them highly visible rather than camouflaged. Their conspicuous features are likely used for species recognition and communication within their social group, not for concealment from predators in this specific habitat."
