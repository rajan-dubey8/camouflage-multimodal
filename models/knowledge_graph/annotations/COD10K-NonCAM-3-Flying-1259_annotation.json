  "explanation": "The bird, identified as a Scrub-Jay, is clearly visible and not camouflaged. Its distinct blue and light gray plumage stands out sharply against the predominantly green and blurry natural background. There is a high contrast in both color and texture between the bird and its surroundings, particularly as it is perched on a human hand, further emphasizing its lack of concealment. Its coloration does not blend, mimic, or disrupt its outline to match the environment."
