  "explanation": "The toad exhibits excellent camouflage against the sandy environment. Its skin color is a mottled greyish-brown with subtle olive/yellowish tones, which closely matches the light greyish-brown of the surrounding sand. Crucially, a significant amount of sand particles are adhering to the toad's warty skin, enhancing its texture similarity to the granular ground. This combination of highly similar colors and textures creates a low contrast difference, effectively disrupting the toad's outline and making it blend remarkably well with its habitat."
