  "object_name": "Sandy beach with human shadows",
  "background_description": "The background is a light beige sandy beach, showing fine granular texture, subtle ripples from what might be receding water, and scattered small dark organic debris like dried seaweed or plant matter, along with tiny shell fragments and pebbles. The sand appears slightly damp in places, reflecting light under bright sunny conditions.",

  "explanation": "The image depicts a sandy beach environment with the distinct, dark shadows of two people projected onto the sand. No actual organisms (animals, insects, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, or arachnids) are visible in the image. Camouflage is a biological adaptation employed by organisms to blend with their surroundings. Since no organism is present, the concept of camouflage does not apply to this scene. The shadows themselves exhibit high contrast against the light sand, making them prominently visible rather than camouflaged."
