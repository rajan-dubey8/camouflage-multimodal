  "background_description": "The scene features a vast expanse of reddish-brown mudflats or sandy shore in the foreground, showing ripple patterns on its surface. Scattered across this ground are bright green-yellow clumps of grass-like vegetation. In the mid-ground, a strip of dark blue water (ocean or large lake) separates the foreground from a distant, hazy skyline. The background consists of a pale, light blue sky and a blurry cityscape/industrial complex on the horizon, including buildings, wind turbines, and red industrial structures emitting white smoke.",
