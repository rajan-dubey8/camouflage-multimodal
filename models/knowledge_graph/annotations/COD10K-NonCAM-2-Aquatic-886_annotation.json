  "background_description": "The background is blurry and out of focus, primarily showing brown and dark grey coral formations or rocky structures with some lighter beige areas. There are also faint blue specks, likely light reflections or indistinct aquatic elements, contributing to a soft, mottled texture.",

  "explanation": "The Lined Surgeonfish exhibits vibrant and contrasting patterns of dark blue stripes on a light grey/white body, with bright blue fin edges and yellow accents. These distinct markings and colors stand out significantly against the blurry, muted brown and dark grey background of coral or rock formations. There is low color and texture similarity, and high contrast, indicating the absence of camouflage. The fish is clearly visible and not attempting to blend in with its surroundings."
