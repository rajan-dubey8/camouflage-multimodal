  "explanation": "Both toads display excellent camouflage through color blending and texture mimicry. The larger toad is a mottled brown, closely matching the darker earth and shadow tones of the gravelly ground. The smaller toad on top has a greenish-brown hue that blends with variations in the ground's color. Their bumpy, warty skin texture perfectly mimics the rough surface of the small stones and pebbles in the environment. This high similarity in both color and texture, along with low contrast, makes them very difficult to distinguish from their surroundings, effectively camouflaging them against potential predators."
