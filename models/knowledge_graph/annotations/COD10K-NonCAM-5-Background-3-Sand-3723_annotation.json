  "object_name": "Rocky coastal seascape",
  "background_description": "The scene features rugged, dark grey and brown stratified rock formations along a coastline, partially covered with some green moss or algae in places. The rocks meet a calm, deep blue ocean surface, smoothed by a long exposure photographic effect, creating a misty, ethereal appearance around the submerged and partially submerged rocks. The water ranges from a deeper blue further out to a lighter, more greenish-blue near the shore and where it interacts with the rocks.",
