  "background_description": "The image features a vast expanse of open ocean water, with gentle ripples and reflections on its surface creating varying shades of blue and greenish-blue. The horizon line is clearly visible, separating the water from the sky. The sky is partly cloudy, with lighter blue hues near the horizon transitioning to a more dramatic formation of large, white, and grey cumulonimbus clouds on the right side, where a faint rainbow arc is also visible. The overall scene is natural, expansive, and free of man-made structures.",
