  "background_description": "The scene depicts a pine forest, likely after a fire, characterized by numerous tall, slender tree trunks. Many of the tree trunks are blackened and charred, while others have typical dark, textured bark. The undergrowth consists of dry, reddish-brown shrubs and grasses, interspersed with some areas of green foliage on more distant trees. The ground is covered with dry, sparse vegetation, fallen needles, and debris. The sky, visible through the tree canopy, is a clear light blue.",
