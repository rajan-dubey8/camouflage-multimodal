  "explanation": "The two Brown Boobies exhibit no effective camouflage against the light sandy and rocky ground. Their predominant dark brown plumage stands in stark contrast to the very light, almost white background, making them highly visible. While they possess white undersides (countershading), this type of coloration is typically useful for blending against the sky or water from below, rather than against a terrestrial background from a lateral view. Their distinct forms and contrasting colors ensure they are easily spotted in this environment, indicating an absence of camouflage."
