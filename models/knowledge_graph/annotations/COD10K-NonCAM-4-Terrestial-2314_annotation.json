There are distinct green leaves and numerous light to dark brown branches, some with reddish-brown dried leaves.

  "explanation": "The bushbuck exhibits effective camouflage through color blending. Its reddish-brown to golden-brown coat closely matches the warm, earthy tones of the dried leaves and branches prevalent in the background. The animal's fur color also harmonizes with the muted green and brownish undertones of the surrounding vegetation. The natural patterns of light and shadow in the dense foliage further aid in breaking up the animal's outline, reducing its contrast against the environment and allowing it to blend seamlessly into its natural habitat."
