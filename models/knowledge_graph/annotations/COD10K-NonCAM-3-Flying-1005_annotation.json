  "object_name": "Blue Tit",
  "background_description": "The background consists of a dense network of thin, bare tree branches in various shades of brown and reddish-brown. The distant environment is out of focus, showing blurred areas of dark green and brown, suggesting foliage or shadows within a wooded or garden setting.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The Blue Tit displays vibrant yellow plumage on its underside, a distinct blue cap, and black and white facial markings. These bright colors create a significant contrast against the muted brown and reddish-brown branches and the dark, blurred green/brown background. The bird's distinct patterns and coloration do not blend with its surroundings, nor do they mimic any specific background elements. Therefore, no camouflage is present; the bird stands out clearly in the scene."
