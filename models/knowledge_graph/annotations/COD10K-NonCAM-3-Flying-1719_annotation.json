  "explanation": "The owl's plumage displays intricate patterns of light and dark brown, tan, and cream feathers with prominent streaky markings. These varied colors and variegated textures are a classic example of disruptive camouflage, perfectly adapted to mimic the bark of trees and dry foliage in its natural habitat. This patterning effectively breaks up the owl's outline and allows it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, making it extremely difficult for both predators and prey to detect."
