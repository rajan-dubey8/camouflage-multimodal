  "background_description": "The scene depicts a clear, tranquil sea meeting a rugged, rocky coastline under bright sunlight. The water is a gradient of turquoise and deep blue, transparent enough to reveal the pebbles and larger rocks on the seabed below. The coastline consists of diverse rock formations, ranging in color from light grey and off-white to darker browns and blacks, with rough, textured surfaces and sharp edges. Sunlight creates strong contrasts, highlighting some areas and casting deep shadows in others.",
