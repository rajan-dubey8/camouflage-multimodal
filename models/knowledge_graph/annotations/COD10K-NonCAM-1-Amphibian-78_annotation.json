  "explanation": "A brown common frog is clearly visible on a bright green grassy background. The frog's brown coloration and smooth, moist skin texture contrast significantly with the verdant, textured blades of grass, making it stand out prominently. While frogs are amphibians and often associated with aquatic environments, this specific image depicts the animal on land. Therefore, there is no camouflage present."
