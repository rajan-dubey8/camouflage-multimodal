  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of a large tree trunk with dark, rough, deeply furrowed bark. There are areas of decaying wood with irregular textures, deep crevices, and some lighter patches of possibly lichen or dried wood. In the mid-ground and background, out-of-focus green foliage is visible, with a couple of distinct green leaves in the foreground, partially obscuring the lizard's lower body.",

  "camouflage_type": "Color blending / Pattern matching / Shape disruption",
  "explanation": "The lizard demonstrates highly effective camouflage through a combination of color blending, pattern matching, and subtle shape disruption. Its body is covered in a mottled pattern of dark greys, blacks, and light tan/cream patches, which perfectly mimic the natural variations in color, texture, and shadows found on the rough, fissured tree bark and decaying wood. The intricate patterns on its scales break up its outline, making it difficult to discern where the lizard ends and the tree begins. The scaly texture of its skin also closely resembles the coarse texture of the bark, further enhancing its ability to blend seamlessly into the environment. While its head is slightly lighter, the overall effect is one of strong concealment."
