  "explanation": "The butterfly displays prominent black wings with striking white and light blue patterns. These distinct colors and patterns create a high contrast against the green foliage and brown ground of the background. There is no attempt at color blending or texture matching with the surrounding environment; rather, the butterfly stands out clearly. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
