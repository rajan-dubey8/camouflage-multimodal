  "explanation": "The image features a large African Elephant prominently in the center. Its massive size and solid grey coloration create a high contrast against both the dry, light-colored grass and the dense, green foliage in the background. Elephants are not known to rely on camouflage for concealment; their sheer scale makes blending into most environments impractical. Thus, the elephant stands out clearly and exhibits no camouflage."
