  "background_description": "The image displays a vast expanse of green-turquoise colored water, likely an ocean or large lake, seen from above. The surface has visible ripples and small waves, creating a textured pattern. Sunlight reflects brightly off parts of the water, creating shimmering streaks and patches of white light, especially towards the bottom right, indicating clear water under direct illumination. A small, weathered brown object, possibly a wooden plank or part of a structure, is partially visible at the very bottom edge.",
