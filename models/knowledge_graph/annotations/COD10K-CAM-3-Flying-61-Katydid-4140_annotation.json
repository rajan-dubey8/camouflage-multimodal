  "object_name": "Katydid",
  "background_description": "The background consists of dense green foliage, primarily leaves and fuzzy green/brown stems. Some leaves are in sharp focus, revealing detailed textures and veins, while others are softly blurred. There is a striped, possibly damaged stem or chrysalis, with brown and lighter bands near the bottom left.",

  "camouflage_type": "Mimicry",
  "explanation": "The Katydid demonstrates exceptional camouflage through mimicry. Its entire body, particularly its large wings, is a vivid green that perfectly matches the color of the surrounding leaves. The texture of its wings also features patterns resembling leaf veins, enhancing the illusion. Its flattened, leaf-like body shape further contributes to its ability to blend seamlessly into the foliage. The low contrast between the Katydid and its environment, combined with the high similarity in color and texture, makes it extremely difficult to discern, showcasing highly effective camouflage."
