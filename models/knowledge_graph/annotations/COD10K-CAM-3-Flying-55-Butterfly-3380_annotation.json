Some areas show darker green foliage and possibly blurred grass further in the background, creating a dense, natural environment. The lighting is soft and diffused.",

  "explanation": "The butterfly exhibits effective camouflage through mimicry. Its wings, folded vertically, display intricate patterns of light brown, tan, and cream with darker brown wavy lines and markings. These colors and patterns strongly resemble a dried leaf or a piece of bark, allowing it to blend remarkably well with the brown branches and the varied textures of the natural environment, despite the prominent green leaves. While its shape is still discernible, the detailed patterns and coloration disrupt its outline and allow it to be easily overlooked, especially when resting on a branch."
