  "background_description": "The background consists of a rocky seafloor with large, grey-brown textured rocks, some showing patches of purplish encrusting organisms. Abundant marine flora is present, most notably bright yellow, highly branched, frilly plant-like structures, and some longer, flatter, brownish kelp-like strands. The very bottom appears to be a sandy/gravelly substrate.",

  "explanation": "The Leafy Sea Dragons in this image exhibit exceptional camouflage. Their bodies are a yellowish-orange color with numerous delicate, leaf-like appendages that perfectly mimic the shape, color, and texture of the surrounding bright yellow marine plants. The appendages effectively break up the sea dragon's outline, making it incredibly difficult to distinguish from the plant life. The coloration blends seamlessly with the dominant yellow flora, and the translucent quality of their 'leaves' further enhances their ability to disappear into the environment. This combination of mimicry and shape disruption results in a highly effective camouflage against both predators and potential prey."
