  "background_description": "The image features a dramatic desert landscape dominated by a massive, curving orange sand dune on the right, casting a deep shadow on its side, creating a clear boundary. The rest of the dune is brightly lit, showing smooth, rippled sand textures. Sparse, light-green vegetation dots the face of the dune. The foreground consists of a flat, dry, stony, and sandy plain in muted brown and grey tones. Several gnarled, dark-barked trees, mostly bare, are scattered across this plain at the base of the dune. A line of small dark posts or stakes runs horizontally across the mid-ground.",
