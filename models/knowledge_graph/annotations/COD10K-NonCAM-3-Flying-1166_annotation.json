  "explanation": "The image clearly depicts a Brown Pelican against a plain, out-of-focus dark greenish-grey background. The bird's distinct coloration, featuring bright yellow on the head, white on the neck, and dark plumage/bill, stands out significantly from the uniform background. There is no visual attempt for the bird to blend in or hide within this specific scene; it is the prominent subject. Therefore, no camouflage is present."
