  "background_description": "The background consists primarily of a large, deeply furrowed tree trunk with rough, dark brown and grey bark, showing patches of lighter, sunlit areas and darker shadowed crevices. Surrounding the trunk are sparse branches with green leaves, and a pale blue sky is visible in the upper background.",

  "explanation": "The leopard demonstrates excellent camouflage through pattern matching and color blending. Its tawny base coat closely matches the sunlit sections of the tree bark, while its characteristic dark rosettes effectively mimic the shadows, deep furrows, and irregularities in the rough tree trunk. This disruptive coloration breaks up the leopard's outline, making it difficult to distinguish from the complex background of the bark and dappled light, thereby reducing the overall contrast difference between the animal and its environment. The combination of color and pattern allows the leopard to blend seamlessly with the tree, especially while climbing or resting."
