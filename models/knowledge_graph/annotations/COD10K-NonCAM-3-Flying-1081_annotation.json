  "object_category": "Bird",
  "object_name": "Seagull",
  "background_description": "The background consists of highly blurred green foliage, creating a bokeh effect with distinct circular light blurs in various shades of green and some lighter, possibly sky-reflected, areas. A dark, thin horizontal line (likely a wire or thin branch) is visible beneath the bird.",

  "camouflage_type": "None",
  "explanation": "The seagull's plumage, predominantly white on its head and underparts, and light grey on its back and wings, creates a stark contrast against the vibrant green and blurred textures of the leafy background. There is very low color and texture similarity between the bird and its surroundings. Its bright colors make it highly visible, indicating a complete absence of camouflage in this particular environment."
