There are prominent vertical cracks or indentations, particularly on the left, with some reddish-brown streaky patches indicating older or peeling bark. The overall texture is mottled and granular.",

  "explanation": "The spider exhibits excellent camouflage by perfectly blending with the tree bark. Its body and legs are a light greyish-brown, almost identical in hue to the surrounding bark. Furthermore, the spider's integument has a speckled or granular pattern that precisely mimics the rough, mottled texture of the bark, including darker spots that match the natural variations in the wood. The overall contrast between the spider and its environment is extremely low, making its outline difficult to discern. Its flattened posture and splayed, slender legs also contribute to shape disruption, further aiding in its concealment."
