# 🎯 Multimodal Camouflage Detection

Combining **Region Graph (RG)** visual features and **Knowledge Graph (KG)** semantic knowledge for improved camouflage detection.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project proposes a **Multimodal Camouflage Detection Model** that fuses visual and semantic embeddings from both **Region Graphs (RG)** and **Knowledge Graphs (KG)** using a **cross-attention fusion network**.  
The approach aims to better detect camouflaged objects by integrating local visual cues with contextual semantic understanding.
